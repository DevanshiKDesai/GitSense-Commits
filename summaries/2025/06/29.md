# Activity Summary for 6/29/2025

## 12:27:33 AM
The log shows development on a FastAPI backend application, focusing on database interactions for logging user behavior and transaction data.

Initially, `behavior.py` and `transaction.py` were created, handling the logging of behavioral events and transactions, respectively.  Both routers used similar structures to interact with the database (`SessionLocal`).  `transaction.py` underwent multiple revisions without code changes between  11:30:01 PM and 11:38:56 PM.  Around 11:39 PM, both routers were significantly updated to include error handling (try-except blocks) for HTTPExceptions and generic exceptions, checking for the existence of a session ID before proceeding.

At 11:39:22 PM,  `transaction.py`'s corresponding schema file (`transaction.py`) was created defining `TransactionProfileCreate` and `TransactionProfileResponse` Pydantic models.

A significant change occurred around 11:49 PM to 12:00 AM, involving the `models.py` file.  This file, defining the database models using SQLAlchemy, was updated to correct the `user_id` column type in the `TransactionProfile` class from `String` to `Integer` and add a ForeignKey constraint to the `users` table.  Additionally, relationships between models were refined. The `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line was moved to ensure that database tables are created correctly.  Concurrently, the `transaction.py` schema file was adjusted to reflect the updated `user_id` type.

Finally, the `main.py` file (the main application file) was updated around 12:11 AM to include `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` ensuring database models creation during startup, and a minor comment was added in `transaction.py` around 12:20 AM.  There were also multiple redundant entries in `main.py` without code changes.

The overall pattern indicates a structured approach to building the application, with iterative refinements to error handling and database schema.  The major focus was on the integration between the `transaction` and `behavior` API endpoints and the database. The application uses FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic for data validation and ORM.


## 1:27:34 AM
The code changes between 1:11 AM and 1:16 AM on June 29th, 2025, primarily focus on implementing user activity tracking and sending this data, along with transaction data, to a backend API (likely FastAPI, running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

`CartContext.jsx` (1:11 AM): This file defines a React context for managing a shopping cart, providing functions to add and remove items, updating quantities accordingly.  No changes were made to the file in this log.

`UserActivityTracker.jsx` (1:13 AM): This component tracks user interactions (clicks, mouse movements, key presses, scrolling) and idle time.  New features include tracking key presses (Arrow keys specifically) and scrolling direction. The component now exposes a `getBehaviorData` method to retrieve collected data, including a session ID ("session123" - placeholder),  keystroke counts, mouse interactions, scroll counts, idle events and total session time.  Event listeners are added and cleanly removed in the `useEffect` cleanup function.


`TrackingContext.jsx` (1:13 AM): This context provider manages session IDs (using `uuidv4`), mouse clicks, keyboard presses, and idle time.  A new session ID is generated using `uuidv4` and a POST request is made to the backend to create the session. Event listeners track clicks, key presses and mouse movements to update the relevant state variables. The `keyboardPresses` state is renamed to `keyPresses` for consistency.

`behaviorApi.js` (1:14 AM): This module uses Axios to send behavioral data (likely the data collected by `UserActivityTracker.jsx`) to the `/behavior/` endpoint of the backend API.

`transactionApi.js` (1:16 AM): This module uses Axios to send transaction data to the `/transactions/` endpoint of the same backend API.  The structure is very similar to `behaviorApi.js`.

The overall pattern shows a system designed to monitor user activity and transaction details, sending this combined data to a centralized backend for analysis or storage.  The use of Axios and similar error handling in both API interaction modules highlights a consistent approach to API calls.  The use of UUIDs ensures unique session identifiers.  The consistent use of `http://127.0.0.1:8000` suggests a local development environment.


## 3:48:03 PM
The codebase shows development of a system for tracking user behavior and transactions.  Significant changes occurred between 2:52 PM and 3:32 PM on June 29, 2025.

**`Api.js`**: This file underwent two major updates.  Initially (2:52 PM), it defined functions `sendBehavioralData` and `sendTransactionData` to send data to a FastAPI backend located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Later (3:14 PM), a `createSession` function was added to handle session creation on the backend.

**`sessions.py`**: This FastAPI router (2:55 PM) handles the creation of user sessions.  It uses a database (`SessionLocal`) for persistence, includes error handling and database transaction management (rollback on failure, close connection in `finally` block), and returns a `SessionResponse` object. The endpoint was updated at 3:25 PM, correcting the endpoint to `/sessions/`.

**`TrackingContext.jsx`**: This React component (3:05 PM, with subsequent updates until 3:32 PM) manages the tracking of user behavior (mouse clicks, keyboard presses, idle time).  It generates a unique session ID using `uuidv4` and sends this ID to the backend to create a new session.  The original implementation used `fetch` to create sessions; later versions had various syntax errors in the `fetch` calls fixed.  A key change involved adding `user_id: 1` to the session creation payload, although this hardcoded ID needs replacement with a dynamically fetched user ID. Event listeners are set up for mouse clicks, key presses, and mouse movements to track user activity and idle time. The component also renames the `keyboardPresses` state variable to `keyPresses` for consistency.


**`base_schemas.py`**: This file (updated at 3:06 PM and 3:22 PM) defines Pydantic schemas for data models, including `UserCreate`, `UserLogin`, `UserResponse`, `SessionCreate`, `SessionResponse`, `BehavioralEventCreate`, `BehavioralEventResponse`, `TransactionProfileCreate`, and `TransactionProfileResponse`. The `SessionCreate` schema was updated to use `Optional[datetime]` for `start_time` and `end_time` to allow flexibility in handling session start and end times.

**`Checkout.jsx`**: This React component (3:08 PM, with updates at 3:16 PM and 3:16 PM) handles the checkout process.  It integrates with the tracking context to send behavioral data after checkout.  Initially, it lacked error handling for sending the behavioral data,  which is added subsequently. Importantly, it incorporates a `useRef` hook (`hasSent`) to prevent multiple sending of behavioral data and a similar `hasSessionLogged` to prevent resending session data. Additional imports for session logging (`createSession`) were added.

**`main.py`**: This FastAPI main application file (3:10 PM) sets up the application, including CORS middleware to allow requests from any origin.  It includes all defined routers (`users`, `sessions`, `behavior`, `transaction`).

**`models.py`**:  This file (updated at 3:20 PM and 3:21 PM) defines the SQLAlchemy models for the database. Key changes were ensuring relationships between `User` and `Session`, and correcting the data type of `session_id` in the `TransactionProfile` model to `String(255)`.  The relationships between `User`, `Session`, `BehavioralEvent`, and `TransactionProfile` are explicitly defined using `relationship` to enable data retrieval across tables.

In summary, the log depicts the development of a system integrating frontend user behavior tracking with a backend for data storage and processing. The system collects data on mouse clicks, keyboard presses, idle time, and potentially other user interactions during checkout, making it suitable for various analytics, user experience, or fraud detection applications.  The final changes centered on refining session handling on both the front-end and back-end and resolving syntax errors in the `TrackingContext.jsx` file.


## 5:30:42 PM
The log shows development activity across a backend API (using FastAPI) and a React frontend component.

The `sessions.py` file shows a FastAPI router for creating sessions.  No functional changes were made to this file between 4:07:55 PM and 4:08:32 PM; the code is identical in both entries. This suggests a potential recording error or an unnecessary commit.

The `TrackingContext.jsx` file, modified at 4:09:36 PM, introduces a React context for tracking user activity (mouse clicks, keyboard presses, idle time). It creates a new session on the backend via a POST request to `/sessions/` using a UUID. A  rename from `keyPresses` to `keyboardPresses` is noted to ensure compatibility with another component (Checkout.jsx).  Event listeners capture user interactions, and idle time is tracked using `setInterval`.

The `models.py` file, updated twice (at 4:22:15 PM and 4:22:28 PM), defines SQLAlchemy models for users, sessions, behavioral events, and transaction profiles. The only difference between the two commits seems to be the import of `sqlalchemy.sql.func` in the second commit.  This file defines the database schema. Key changes include fixing the `user_id` type in `TransactionProfile` and ensuring the creation of all tables using `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`.  Comments indicate the importance of the `sessions` relationship in the `User` model and highlight structural elements within the code.
