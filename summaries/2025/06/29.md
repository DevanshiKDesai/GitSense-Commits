# Activity Summary for 6/29/2025

## 12:27:33 AM
The log shows development on a FastAPI backend application, focusing on database interactions for logging user behavior and transaction data.

Initially, `behavior.py` and `transaction.py` were created, handling the logging of behavioral events and transactions, respectively.  Both routers used similar structures to interact with the database (`SessionLocal`).  `transaction.py` underwent multiple revisions without code changes between  11:30:01 PM and 11:38:56 PM.  Around 11:39 PM, both routers were significantly updated to include error handling (try-except blocks) for HTTPExceptions and generic exceptions, checking for the existence of a session ID before proceeding.

At 11:39:22 PM,  `transaction.py`'s corresponding schema file (`transaction.py`) was created defining `TransactionProfileCreate` and `TransactionProfileResponse` Pydantic models.

A significant change occurred around 11:49 PM to 12:00 AM, involving the `models.py` file.  This file, defining the database models using SQLAlchemy, was updated to correct the `user_id` column type in the `TransactionProfile` class from `String` to `Integer` and add a ForeignKey constraint to the `users` table.  Additionally, relationships between models were refined. The `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line was moved to ensure that database tables are created correctly.  Concurrently, the `transaction.py` schema file was adjusted to reflect the updated `user_id` type.

Finally, the `main.py` file (the main application file) was updated around 12:11 AM to include `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` ensuring database models creation during startup, and a minor comment was added in `transaction.py` around 12:20 AM.  There were also multiple redundant entries in `main.py` without code changes.

The overall pattern indicates a structured approach to building the application, with iterative refinements to error handling and database schema.  The major focus was on the integration between the `transaction` and `behavior` API endpoints and the database. The application uses FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic for data validation and ORM.


## 1:27:34 AM
The code changes between 1:11 AM and 1:16 AM on June 29th, 2025, primarily focus on implementing user activity tracking and sending this data, along with transaction data, to a backend API (likely FastAPI, running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

`CartContext.jsx` (1:11 AM): This file defines a React context for managing a shopping cart, providing functions to add and remove items, updating quantities accordingly.  No changes were made to the file in this log.

`UserActivityTracker.jsx` (1:13 AM): This component tracks user interactions (clicks, mouse movements, key presses, scrolling) and idle time.  New features include tracking key presses (Arrow keys specifically) and scrolling direction. The component now exposes a `getBehaviorData` method to retrieve collected data, including a session ID ("session123" - placeholder),  keystroke counts, mouse interactions, scroll counts, idle events and total session time.  Event listeners are added and cleanly removed in the `useEffect` cleanup function.


`TrackingContext.jsx` (1:13 AM): This context provider manages session IDs (using `uuidv4`), mouse clicks, keyboard presses, and idle time.  A new session ID is generated using `uuidv4` and a POST request is made to the backend to create the session. Event listeners track clicks, key presses and mouse movements to update the relevant state variables. The `keyboardPresses` state is renamed to `keyPresses` for consistency.

`behaviorApi.js` (1:14 AM): This module uses Axios to send behavioral data (likely the data collected by `UserActivityTracker.jsx`) to the `/behavior/` endpoint of the backend API.

`transactionApi.js` (1:16 AM): This module uses Axios to send transaction data to the `/transactions/` endpoint of the same backend API.  The structure is very similar to `behaviorApi.js`.

The overall pattern shows a system designed to monitor user activity and transaction details, sending this combined data to a centralized backend for analysis or storage.  The use of Axios and similar error handling in both API interaction modules highlights a consistent approach to API calls.  The use of UUIDs ensures unique session identifiers.  The consistent use of `http://127.0.0.1:8000` suggests a local development environment.
