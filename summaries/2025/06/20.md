# Activity Summary for 6/20/2025

## 4:15:50 PM
The log shows development of a React application, likely a Walmart clone.  The `package.json` file remained unchanged between 3:25 PM and 3:33 PM, indicating no dependency or script changes during that period.


Between 3:35 PM and 3:36 PM, the `AuthProvider.jsx` component was updated, adding state management for user authentication (`signin`, `auth`), cart functionality (`cart`), user details (`email`, `name`, `password`, `number`), menu state (`isMenuOpen`), search functionality (`search`), product details (`productDetails`),  and a counter for items and total price in cart (`count`, `totalPrice`).  The component also uses local storage to persist user email, name, and password.

From 3:42 PM to 3:55 PM, the `Searchmenu.jsx` component underwent several revisions.  Initially, it included `MenuDivider` component, then it was removed, and finally it was added back.  This suggests iterative refinement of the search menu's visual presentation using Chakra UI components.

At 3:50 PM, the `App.jsx` component was updated to conditionally render a `Pannel` component based on the cart state from the `AuthContext`. At 3:56 PM,  `"./style/App.css"` was added to the import statements in `App.jsx`, suggesting the addition of styles.

Finally, at 3:56 PM, the `index.html` file was updated, adding a stylesheet link for Font Awesome (version 6.5.1) and  Google fonts (Roboto), indicating the use of these libraries for styling and icons in the application.
