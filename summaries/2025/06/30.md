# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 12:53:10 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on adding user activity tracking to a React application.

**Checkout.jsx (6/30/2025, 12:03:40 AM):** This component was updated to include functionality for sending behavioral and transaction data to an API (`sendBehavioralData`, `sendTransactionData`, `createSession`).  It uses a `TrackerRefContext` to access user activity data and handles toast notifications for successful or failed API calls.  The `user_id` is hardcoded as `1` and should be replaced with the actual user ID.

**App.jsx (Multiple updates):**  The `App.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 12:27:05 AM and 12:48:15 AM.  These changes centered around implementing a comprehensive user activity tracking system.

* **12:27:05 AM and 12:27:17 AM:** A `LiveBehaviorSender` component was introduced to send behavioral data every 10 seconds and on page unload using `navigator.sendBeacon`.  The `TrackerRefContext` was created and exported to make the tracker reference accessible across components. The `sendBehavioralData` API call path was updated to `./api/Api` from `./api/behaviorApi`.

* **12:29:47 AM:** The `LiveBehaviorSender` component was removed from `App.jsx`, simplifying the component structure. The `TrackerRefContext` remains for global access to the tracker.

* **12:48:05 AM and 12:48:15 AM:** Session creation was moved to the `App.jsx` using `useEffect` and `uuidv4` for generating session IDs.  The session ID is now stored in the `TrackingContext`. The `createSession` API call path was corrected to `./api/Api`.  Toast messages provide feedback to the user about session creation success or failure.  This version leverages the `AuthContext` to get the `user_id`.  The hardcoded `user_id` in `Checkout.jsx` should be removed in favor of this approach.

**Api.js (6/30/2025, 12:45:44 AM):**  This file contains the API interaction functions (`sendBehavioralData`, `sendTransactionData`, and `createSession`).  It uses Axios for `sendBehavioralData` and `sendTransactionData` and `fetch` for `createSession`. All functions handle potential errors and provide logging.  The base URL is set to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, suggesting a local development environment.


In summary, the code changes demonstrate a progressive implementation of a user activity tracking system.  The initial approach involved separate, less efficient sending of data, which evolved into a more integrated and robust solution with session management and user identification. The `user_id` handling should be consistently managed in favor of pulling the value from the `AuthContext` rather than hardcoding it.  The API endpoints (`/behavior/`, `/transactions/`, `/sessions/`) suggest interaction with a backend service for storing and processing the tracked data.
