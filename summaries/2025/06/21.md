# Activity Summary for 6/21/2025

## 12:45:06 AM
The log shows development of a Walmart clone e-commerce application using React and Chakra UI.  Significant changes occurred around 11:47 PM and 12:10 AM on June 20th and 21st, 2025, respectively.

`Allroutes.jsx` underwent multiple revisions, primarily refining the routing configuration. Initially, there were redundant routes for `/product/:id`, targeting both `SearchProduct` and `ProductDetails`.  The final version consolidated these into a single route for `/product/:id` pointing to `ProductDetails`,  and created a separate `/products` route for `ProductPage` suggesting a move toward  a cleaner separation of product listing and individual product detail views. The unnecessary `useContext` and `AuthContext` imports were removed as well.

`Cart.jsx` was updated once, improving the UI and adding toast notifications using `useToast` for cart actions (clearing the cart, adding items). The layout was adjusted for better responsiveness, notably repositioning the order summary section to the right on larger screens. The `top` value of the order summary was also adjusted from 250px to 200px for better accommodation.

`products.js` was updated twice, expanding the product list and replacing placeholder image URLs with actual image URLs. Initially two products were shown and in the final version seven products across three categories(Electronics, Women's Fashion, Men's Fashion) were added.

`ProductPage.jsx` saw several edits, mainly correcting the import path for `productList` to `products` and fixing the component export name from `Home` to `ProductPage`.

`ProductDetails.jsx` was revised to improve the component's data fetching and display logic.  The initial version used a local `productList`.  The final version demonstrates the intent to fetch product details dynamically using `useParams()` from the URL. The `fallbackSrc` for the Image component was removed from the final version. Also the styling was changed from chakra UI components to div tags.

`Products1.jsx` underwent several iterations, evolving from a basic product display to a more refined and responsive layout. It integrates Chakra UI components for styling, uses `useToast` for notifications, and uses the  `AuthContext` for adding products to the cart. Initially `products` was not defined and later it was defined directly from `productList` in `products.js`.  Finally the code was updated to use  `react-router-dom's` `Link` component for navigation to product detail pages, eliminating unnecessary state updates. The `setDetails` function from the `AuthContext` was removed from final version suggesting a direct data fetching approach in `ProductDetails.jsx`. Defensive checks were added to handle the cases of potentially missing `currentPrice` and `originalPrice`  in the `product` objects, replacing them with 'N/A' if not defined.

`Product5.jsx` and `Product2.jsx` are components displaying products, incorporating responsive design,  cart functionality via `AuthContext`, and detailed toast messages.  `Product2.jsx` had a significant refactor, removing unused video-related code and improving the overall structure and responsiveness.  The defensive check for a numeric `price` before applying `toFixed(2)` was also added to prevent errors from non-numeric values. Finally the structure was also improved in terms of making it more readable.

`Navbar.jsx` showcases a complex component with multiple menu options, search functionality, and account management. The changes included improvements to responsiveness, adding hover effects, updating styling of buttons, and fixing typos.  The `flexbox` import was removed, and various styling attributes were refined for better visual appearance and responsiveness. A controlled input was implemented for the search bar.
The `AuthContext` was extensively used in multiple components, providing a centralized state management solution for authentication and cart data.  The implementation shows careful handling of local storage for persistence of user authentication and cart items.  Error handling is also included in several places to mitigate issues with loading data from local storage and converting data types.
