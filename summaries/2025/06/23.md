# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 12:37:00 AM
The log shows modifications to two main files: `Products1.jsx` and `Sunglasses.jsx`.  `Products1.jsx` was renamed to `ProductListLoop.jsx` and underwent several revisions between 11:37 PM and 11:38 PM on June 22nd, 2025, primarily focusing on the  "View All Products" button's text.  The final version displays a maximum of 8 products initially, allowing users to view all products with the "View All Products" button. The component uses Chakra UI for styling and React Router for navigation.  It features product cards with add-to-cart functionality and heart icons (favorites).

`Sunglasses.jsx` experienced more extensive changes between 11:40 PM on June 22nd and 12:34 AM on June 23rd, 2025. Initial changes involved adding more product items to the `packingProducts` and `festivalProducts` arrays.  Later versions introduced a "View More/Show Less" functionality, initially showing only three products and allowing users to expand the display.  A significant update at 12:34 AM exported the `packingProducts` and `festivalProducts` arrays to enable their use in `ProductDetails.jsx`. The final version of `Sunglasses.jsx` includes detailed product information (brand, material, color, etc.) within each product's array, and  the component now uses `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent accidental propagation of click events.  The product cards in `Sunglasses.jsx`  now navigate to `/product-details/:id` using `useNavigate`.  There is also a banner section with an image (`boyAndGirl.png`).

There's a consistent pattern of using Chakra UI components (`Box`, `Button`, `Image`, `Text`, `SimpleGrid`, `Flex`, etc.) throughout both files.  The `addToCart` function (from `AuthContext`) is consistently used for adding items to the cart across both components. Both files also incorporate a mechanism for displaying a limited number of products initially and offering the option to expand the display using a button.  Lastly, both components make use of `react-router-dom` for navigation, employing both `Link` and `useNavigate` components.
