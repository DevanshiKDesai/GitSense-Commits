# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 5:13:28 PM
The provided log only contains a file path (`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\VS Codes\WalmartClone\WalmartClone\.gitignore`) and a timestamp (6/26/2025, 4:18:53 PM), but no actual code changes.  Therefore, no summary of code changes can be provided.  The `.gitignore` file likely existed at that time, but its content is unknown, and no modifications to it are recorded in this log entry.


## 10:10:34 PM
The log shows two nearly identical entries for `.gitignore` at 6:50:56 PM and 6:51:08 PM on June 26, 2025.  These entries define gitignore rules, excluding various log files, build directories (`node_modules`, `dist`, `dist-ssr`), editor-specific files, and temporary files from version control.

A more significant change occurred at 9:31:51 PM on June 26, 2025, to `src/components/UserActivityTracker.jsx`. This file contains React code for a component that tracks user activity, including mouse clicks, key presses (arrow keys specifically), scroll direction, and idle time.  The component displays this tracked information in a fixed overlay on the page.  The idle timeout is set to 30 seconds (IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS).  The component uses `useEffect` hook to add and remove event listeners, ensuring cleanup on unmount.
