# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 5:13:28 PM
The provided log only contains a file path (`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\VS Codes\WalmartClone\WalmartClone\.gitignore`) and a timestamp (6/26/2025, 4:18:53 PM), but no actual code changes.  Therefore, no summary of code changes can be provided.  The `.gitignore` file likely existed at that time, but its content is unknown, and no modifications to it are recorded in this log entry.


## 10:10:34 PM
The log shows two nearly identical entries for `.gitignore` at 6:50:56 PM and 6:51:08 PM on June 26, 2025.  These entries define gitignore rules, excluding various log files, build directories (`node_modules`, `dist`, `dist-ssr`), editor-specific files, and temporary files from version control.

A more significant change occurred at 9:31:51 PM on June 26, 2025, to `src/components/UserActivityTracker.jsx`. This file contains React code for a component that tracks user activity, including mouse clicks, key presses (arrow keys specifically), scroll direction, and idle time.  The component displays this tracked information in a fixed overlay on the page.  The idle timeout is set to 30 seconds (IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS).  The component uses `useEffect` hook to add and remove event listeners, ensuring cleanup on unmount.


## 11:17:05 PM
The log shows repeated updates to a `.env` file between 10:26 PM and 10:31 PM on June 26, 2025.  All updates set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the same path: `C:\Users\devan\Desktop\VS Codes\Bliss IQ\TTS\backend\blissiqpro-8490b5cdfbac.json`.  There were no actual changes to the content of the variable across the multiple updates.  The repeated entries suggest possible attempts to save the environment variable, perhaps due to an editor issue or a save operation that was not initially successful.
