# Activity Summary for 9/6/2025

## 11:17:51 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `Checkout.jsx` component and the creation of a `TrackingContext.jsx` file.  The changes primarily focus on refactoring the session management and user tracking logic.

**`Checkout.jsx` Changes:**

The `Checkout.jsx` component underwent significant changes across multiple commits.  Initially, it contained its own logic for creating and ending shopping sessions (`createSession`, `endSession`, `fetchSession`).  The component also managed its own session ID and session data in local state.

Between `9/6/2025, 10:20:41 PM` and `9/6/2025, 10:32:50 PM`, the `handlePlaceOrder` function was modified. The most significant changes involved simplifying the transaction request body in the `handlePlaceOrder` function by removing unnecessary data points like `average_purchase_value` and `purchase_frequency`.

Finally, between  `9/6/2025, 11:11:05 PM` and `9/6/2025, 11:16:43 PM`, the component was refactored to eliminate duplicated code and improve maintainability.  The session management logic was entirely removed from `Checkout.jsx`. It now retrieves session data and a reset function from the newly introduced `TrackingContext`, removing the local management of `sessionId` and `sessionData`.  The `resetSession` function, obtained from the context, is now used to clear the session after a successful order placement. The unnecessary `useEffect` hook was removed from `Checkout.jsx`.

**`TrackingContext.jsx` Creation:**

A new file, `TrackingContext.jsx`, was introduced at `9/6/2025, 11:10:41 PM`. This file implements a React context (`TrackingContext`) to manage session data (`sessionData`, `sessionId`), and user tracking metrics (mouse clicks, mouse moves, keystrokes, scrolls, idle time, etc.). The context includes functions to get behavioral metrics (`getBehavioralMetrics`) and to reset the session (`resetSession`).  The session creation logic is now handled within the context provider, ensuring that session information is centrally managed. The context takes `initialUserId` and `authenticatedUser` as props to support various user authentication scenarios.  The use of `useCallback` for several functions improves performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   The consistent use of `axios` for API calls to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
*   Extensive use of Chakra UI components for the UI rendering.
*   Error handling with `try...catch` blocks.
*   Use of `useMemo` for performance optimization of calculations.
*   Clear separation of concerns through the introduction of the `TrackingContext`.


In summary, the code evolution showcases a shift from a component-centric approach to session management to a more centralized, context-based solution. This refactoring improves code organization, maintainability, and reusability of the session and tracking logic.
