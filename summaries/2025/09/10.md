# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 8:22:53 PM
The log shows updates to the frontend and backend components of an application that tracks user behavior.

The `behaviorApi.js` file (frontend) remained unchanged after the initial commit at 7:50 PM on September 10, 2025.  It defines an Axios instance to send behavioral data to a FastAPI backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

The `base_schemas.py` file (backend) was updated at 8:01:51 PM on September 10, 2025. This update added a `place_name` field to the `UserCreate`, `UserResponse`, and `UserLogin` schemas.  The update also consistently uses `from_attributes=True` instead of the deprecated `orm_mode=True` in Pydantic model configurations.  This file defines Pydantic schemas for users, sessions, behavioral events, and transaction profiles.

The `TrackingContext.jsx` file (frontend) was updated at 8:20:01 PM on September 10, 2025.  Significant changes include:

*   Addition of `sessionData` state to store the full session object and expose it through the context.
*   Addition of a `resetSession` function to reset the session state.
*   Improved handling of user ID synchronization between different sources (`initialUserId`, `authenticatedUser`, `siferUserId`).
*   The `getBehavioralMetrics` function now calculates average mouse and typing velocities.  It also captures more comprehensive behavioral data.
*   The `useEffect` hook handling session creation now stores the full session object in the `sessionData` state.  The component now comprehensively tracks various user interactions, including mouse clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes (including arrow keys), scrolling, and idle time.  It calculates metrics such as average mouse and typing velocities and sends this data to the backend.

In summary, the changes reflect an enhancement to a user behavior tracking system. The backend schema was updated to include location data, and the frontend was significantly improved to track more comprehensive user interactions, manage session data more effectively, and provide a `resetSession` functionality.  The consistent use of `from_attributes=True` in the backend indicates a cleanup of deprecated code.
