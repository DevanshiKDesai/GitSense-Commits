# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 8:22:53 PM
The log shows updates to the frontend and backend components of an application that tracks user behavior.

The `behaviorApi.js` file (frontend) remained unchanged after the initial commit at 7:50 PM on September 10, 2025.  It defines an Axios instance to send behavioral data to a FastAPI backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

The `base_schemas.py` file (backend) was updated at 8:01:51 PM on September 10, 2025. This update added a `place_name` field to the `UserCreate`, `UserResponse`, and `UserLogin` schemas.  The update also consistently uses `from_attributes=True` instead of the deprecated `orm_mode=True` in Pydantic model configurations.  This file defines Pydantic schemas for users, sessions, behavioral events, and transaction profiles.

The `TrackingContext.jsx` file (frontend) was updated at 8:20:01 PM on September 10, 2025.  Significant changes include:

*   Addition of `sessionData` state to store the full session object and expose it through the context.
*   Addition of a `resetSession` function to reset the session state.
*   Improved handling of user ID synchronization between different sources (`initialUserId`, `authenticatedUser`, `siferUserId`).
*   The `getBehavioralMetrics` function now calculates average mouse and typing velocities.  It also captures more comprehensive behavioral data.
*   The `useEffect` hook handling session creation now stores the full session object in the `sessionData` state.  The component now comprehensively tracks various user interactions, including mouse clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes (including arrow keys), scrolling, and idle time.  It calculates metrics such as average mouse and typing velocities and sends this data to the backend.

In summary, the changes reflect an enhancement to a user behavior tracking system. The backend schema was updated to include location data, and the frontend was significantly improved to track more comprehensive user interactions, manage session data more effectively, and provide a `resetSession` functionality.  The consistent use of `from_attributes=True` in the backend indicates a cleanup of deprecated code.


## 9:22:55 PM
The log shows significant updates to the `TrackingContext.jsx` file across multiple commits, focusing on user activity tracking and backend integration.  Initially, `sessionData` and a `resetSession` function were added to the `TrackingContext`, allowing for storing and resetting the complete session object.  Subsequent commits added functionality to send behavioral data to a backend API (`sendBehavioralData` was added as an import and used within a new `useEffect` hook to send data every 15 seconds).

The `base_schemas.py` file was updated to include schemas for User creation, login, sessions, and behavioral events.  The `place_name` field was consistently added to User schemas.  The `BehavioralEvent` schema is finalized, encompassing various user interaction metrics.

The `routers/behavior.py` file, responsible for logging behavioral data, underwent minor refinements for error handling and clarity in comments. The changes here were mostly cosmetic, improving the readability and structure of the code without fundamentally altering functionality.


The `App.jsx` file was modified to remove the automatic creation of anonymous user IDs for tracking.  Instead, it now only checks for existing IDs in local storage, using them if present and otherwise waiting for user authentication.  This change simplifies the initial setup and reduces unnecessary backend requests.  The `AuthProvider.jsx` file was significantly changed to consolidate product lists from various parts of the application into a single, unified `ALL_AVAILABLE_PRODUCTS` array. This simplifies product management and ensures data consistency.  Notably, an API key ('7584147587db66d422ef5c5369737501') for openweathermap.org was exposed, this should be removed from the code for security reasons.


## 11:23:04 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `Footer.jsx` component, primarily involving no code changes.  Between 10:20 PM and 10:24 PM, multiple nearly identical commits were made to `Footer.jsx`. These commits did not alter the code itself.

Subsequently, significant changes were made to other components.  The `Cart.jsx` component was updated at 10:27 PM, introducing improved recommendation logic and fixing issues related to product image and title wrapping within links.  A `ProductListLoop.jsx` update at 10:34 PM added product descriptions and improved styling.

The `Allroutes.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 10:44 PM and 11:20 PM.  These changes standardized product detail routes, corrected the checkout route, and added a catch-all route for handling 404 errors (around 11:16 PM), improving navigation and error handling.   The implementation of the 404 handler was refined, moving the custom 404 component definition into `Allroutes.jsx` for better organization.  Later revisions removed unnecessary routes and focused on a consistent `/product/:productId` pattern.

The `ProductDetails.jsx` component was modified multiple times between 10:44 PM and 11:07 PM.  These changes simplified product-finding logic by using the `allAvailableProducts` list from the `AuthContext` context, improving data reliability and reducing redundancy.

Finally, `CategoryProductsPage.jsx` was updated several times between 10:48 PM and 11:18 PM, removing an effect that hid the Navbar, and correcting the product route links to align with the standardized route in `Allroutes.jsx`. The crucial change here was refactoring to use `allAvailableProducts` from the `AuthContext` instead of a local `productList`, ensuring consistent data across the application.  The backend file `behavior.py` was updated at 11:21 PM to improve its logic for logging behavioral events.  The update efficiently handles both updating existing records and creating new ones based on whether a record already exists for a given session ID, preventing redundant data entries.
