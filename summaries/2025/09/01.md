# Activity Summary for 9/1/2025

## 12:12:16 AM
The codebase underwent significant changes related to user authentication and activity tracking.  The major updates revolve around the introduction and refinement of the "S.I.F.E.R" user tracking system.

**`App.jsx`**: This file was modified multiple times.  Initial changes involved refactoring the conditional rendering based on the `signin` state, now sourced from `AuthContext`. A crucial addition was the `getOrCreateUserByEmail` function from `'./api/userApi'` which enables the automatic creation or retrieval of a user ID for tracking purposes upon application startup. This user ID is stored in `localStorage` under the key `'sifer_user_id'`. Later modifications focused on improving the user experience during initialization and error handling.

**`AuthContext/AuthProvider.jsx`**:  This component was extensively reworked.  The `appUserId` prop was added and utilized for user tracking.  The `register` and `signOut` functions were enhanced to manage the `sifer_user_id` in `localStorage` consistently.  An `useEffect` hook was implemented to restore the authentication state from `localStorage` on component mount. Geolocation data is now captured and included in the authentication process. A key improvement involved the user initialization logic being moved to `AuthProvider` to ensure the SIFER user ID is set correctly before other components relying on it are rendered.  Finally, the `siferUserId` state was introduced to ensure the user ID obtained is maintained.

**`context/TrackingContext.jsx`**: The most significant changes occurred here. Multiple updates added new state variables to track mouse velocity, typing speed, time-to-click, and scroll speed.  The `TrackingContextProvider` now accepts an `initialUserId` and `authenticatedUser` props.  A key change involved moving the user ID initialization logic and the creation of backend sessions into this component for the purpose of more reliably getting a valid SIFER user id.  Event listeners for mouse clicks, mouse movements, key presses, and scrolling events were added and removed appropriately to track user activity. The `getBehavioralMetrics` function was updated to include the new velocity metrics.  Subsequent changes optimized the code for better clarity and performance, particularly in handling event listeners, and removed unneeded props from the provider.  Finally, the `userId` is now sourced from `AuthContext`, simplifying the logic and ensuring consistency.

**`components/UserActivityTracker.jsx`**:  This component was updated to incorporate the new velocity metrics from the `TrackingContext`.  It displays these metrics and uses them in sending behavioral data to the backend via the `sendBehavioralData` function. The `triggerSiferDataSubmission` function now includes more robust error handling for missing session or user IDs, displaying a user friendly error message instead of crashing the app.

**`form/Login.jsx`**:  This file's modifications mainly focused on integrating geolocation data into the login process and redirecting the user upon successful login.  Error handling around geolocation retrieval was also improved, providing the user with more context.



**Recurring elements**:  The key recurring element across all files is the consistent use of `sifer_user_id` stored in `localStorage` for user tracking.  The modifications demonstrate a significant effort to improve the robustness, clarity, and efficiency of the user authentication and activity tracking system, with a focus on error handling and user experience improvements.  The final version simplifies the TrackingContext provider, making it leaner and more reliable by getting the userId and session information from the AuthContext.
