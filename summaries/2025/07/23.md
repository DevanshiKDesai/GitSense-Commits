# Activity Summary for 7/23/2025

## 11:33:20 PM
The `calculate_indices.py` script, updated on July 23, 2025, at 5:52:33 PM, calculates Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) from multispectral satellite imagery.  The script reads three bands (BAND2, BAND3, BAND4, likely corresponding to green, red, and near-infrared) from TIFF files located in input folders ("june" and "july"). It then applies the respective formulas for each index and saves the results as new TIFF files in an "output" folder.  The script uses the `rasterio` and `numpy` libraries for image processing.  The main section iterates through each index and input folder, systematically generating eight output files (two months x four indices).  The output folder is created if it doesn't exist.  The script concludes by printing a confirmation message.
