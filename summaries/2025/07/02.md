# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 10:03:52 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions to the `Checkout.jsx` component and the `Api.js` file between 9:51 PM and 9:52 PM on July 2nd, 2025.  There were no substantive changes in the code of `Checkout.jsx` across revisions; only the timestamp changed.

The `Api.js` file, however, received a significant update at 9:52:49 PM.  This update added two new functions: `createUser` and `loginUser`. These functions, respectively, handle the creation of new users and user login via API calls to `/users/` and `/login/` endpoints on the backend server (located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`, suggesting potential development environment variations).  Both functions include robust error handling, logging success and failure messages to the console.  The existing functions in `Api.js` (`sendBehavioralData`, `sendTransactionData`, `createSession`, `getTransactionProfile`, and `sendUserData`) remained largely unchanged, showing consistency in their handling of API requests and error responses.  The `Checkout.jsx` component consistently uses these API functions across all its revisions.
