# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 10:03:52 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions to the `Checkout.jsx` component and the `Api.js` file between 9:51 PM and 9:52 PM on July 2nd, 2025.  There were no substantive changes in the code of `Checkout.jsx` across revisions; only the timestamp changed.

The `Api.js` file, however, received a significant update at 9:52:49 PM.  This update added two new functions: `createUser` and `loginUser`. These functions, respectively, handle the creation of new users and user login via API calls to `/users/` and `/login/` endpoints on the backend server (located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`, suggesting potential development environment variations).  Both functions include robust error handling, logging success and failure messages to the console.  The existing functions in `Api.js` (`sendBehavioralData`, `sendTransactionData`, `createSession`, `getTransactionProfile`, and `sendUserData`) remained largely unchanged, showing consistency in their handling of API requests and error responses.  The `Checkout.jsx` component consistently uses these API functions across all its revisions.


## 11:03:54 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `Checkout.jsx` component between 10:33 PM and 11:01 PM on July 2nd, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged across these edits; the differences appear to be minor formatting adjustments or perhaps IDE auto-formatting actions.

The `index.html` file was modified earlier at 10:12:54 PM on the same day.  This file is a standard HTML file setting up a React application, including links to external stylesheets (Roboto font, Font Awesome) and a script to load the main application (`main.jsx`).  This indicates the initial setup of the project's frontend.

The `Checkout.jsx` component is a React component responsible for handling the checkout process.  It uses Chakra UI for styling and React Router for navigation. The component manages a multi-step checkout flow, handling user authentication (via `AuthContext`), session management (`TrackingContext`, `createSession`), and user creation (`createUser`).  It also includes functionality for sending behavioral data (`sendBehavioralData`) and likely (although not explicitly implemented in the provided code) transaction data (`sendTransactionData`).  Multiple `useEffect` hooks manage side effects like session logging and behavioral data submission. The code consistently uses asynchronous functions (`async/await`) for API calls.  No significant functional changes are observed in the multiple revisions of `Checkout.jsx`.
