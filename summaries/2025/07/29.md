# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 9:20:57 PM
The log shows two revisions of `export_csv.py` on July 29, 2025.  Both versions are nearly identical, focusing on exporting data from a GeoTIFF file to a CSV.  The key difference lies in the `max_points` handling within the nested loops.

The first version (9:20:13 PM) uses `if count >= max_points: return` to limit the number of exported points. The second version (9:20:39 PM), a minor improvement, changes this condition to `if max_points is not None and count >= max_points: return`, ensuring the code functions correctly when `max_points` is not provided (is `None`).  This prevents a potential error if the function is called without a limit.  Both versions use the `rasterio` library to read the GeoTIFF and write longitude, latitude, and value to the CSV.  The `src.nodata` value is handled to skip null entries.
