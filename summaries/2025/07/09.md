# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 8:10:56 PM
The code implements a React component that displays a course cover image using local storage caching.  The `useCachedImage` custom hook is central to this functionality.

**useCachedImage.js:** This file underwent several revisions. Initially (7/9/2025, 6:31:11 PM and 6:33:46 PM), it fetched a dummy image from `picsum.photos` based on a course ID, checked for its existence using a HEAD request, and cached it in localStorage for 50 minutes.  Later versions removed the HEAD request (7/9/2025, 6:51:32 PM), simplifying the image fetching process.  A significant change occurred at 7/9/2025, 6:58:05 PM and 7/9/2025, 6:59:16 PM, adding error handling and a `courseList` array to validate course IDs, returning an error message if the course ID is invalid. Finally, at 7/9/2025, 7:09:10 PM,  performance logging was added using `console.time` and `performance.now()` to measure the time taken to fetch and render images, differentiating between cached and newly fetched images. The dummy image URL was also modified several times during the development process.


**App.jsx:** This file contains the main React component. Multiple revisions focused on styling and layout improvements from 7/9/2025, 6:33:33 PM onwards.  Changes involved modifications to padding, font family, alignment, width, background color, box shadow, and margins, iteratively improving the visual presentation.  A key change at 7/9/2025, 6:43:27 PM introduced a full-screen gradient background and styled the container for a more visually appealing design. Another major update at 7/9/2025, 6:58:15 PM integrated error handling from `useCachedImage` to display error messages appropriately.  The input field was modified to convert the input to lowercase. The image height was also adjusted several times during development.


The most significant changes were the additions of error handling and performance logging in `useCachedImage.js` and the iterative styling improvements in `App.jsx`. The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement of both the functionality and the user interface.

The log shows a series of modifications to the `useCachedImage.js` and `App.jsx` files within a React project.  The primary focus is on improving an image caching mechanism.

**`useCachedImage.js` File Updates:**

The `useCachedImage.js` file underwent significant changes between 8:11 PM and 8:24 PM.  Initially, the code included a hardcoded `courseList` as an array of objects, then was changed to an array of strings.  The main updates involved the handling of render times and the validation of `courseId`.

* **8:11 PM - 8:15 PM:**  The core functionality of caching images based on `courseId` using `localStorage` was established.  Several versions focused on accurately measuring and displaying `renderTime`, initially using `console.time` and later directly using `performance.now()`.  The error handling for invalid `courseId`s was also refined.

* **8:21 PM - 8:24 PM:**  The `courseList` was simplified to an array of strings.  Unnecessary logging statements were removed,  and the `renderTime` state was consistently set to `null` when an invalid course was detected or when a cached image was used.


**`App.jsx` File Update:**

A single update to `App.jsx` occurred at 8:16 PM. This update integrated the `renderTime` from `useCachedImage` into the UI, displaying it when available and no error occurred. The UI is designed to show cached images, fetched images and loading state of images


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Consistent use of `localStorage` for caching image URLs with expiry times.
* Error handling for invalid `courseId`s.
* Use of `performance.now()` for performance measurement.
* The `courseList` remains a core component, determining valid course IDs.  This list's structure changed from an array of objects to an array of strings during the update.

The final version of `useCachedImage.js` (8:24 PM) presents a streamlined image caching solution with improved performance monitoring and error handling. The `renderTime` is now accurately captured in milliseconds  and displayed on the UI.
