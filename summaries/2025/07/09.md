# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 8:10:56 PM
The code implements a React component that displays a course cover image using local storage caching.  The `useCachedImage` custom hook is central to this functionality.

**useCachedImage.js:** This file underwent several revisions. Initially (7/9/2025, 6:31:11 PM and 6:33:46 PM), it fetched a dummy image from `picsum.photos` based on a course ID, checked for its existence using a HEAD request, and cached it in localStorage for 50 minutes.  Later versions removed the HEAD request (7/9/2025, 6:51:32 PM), simplifying the image fetching process.  A significant change occurred at 7/9/2025, 6:58:05 PM and 7/9/2025, 6:59:16 PM, adding error handling and a `courseList` array to validate course IDs, returning an error message if the course ID is invalid. Finally, at 7/9/2025, 7:09:10 PM,  performance logging was added using `console.time` and `performance.now()` to measure the time taken to fetch and render images, differentiating between cached and newly fetched images. The dummy image URL was also modified several times during the development process.


**App.jsx:** This file contains the main React component. Multiple revisions focused on styling and layout improvements from 7/9/2025, 6:33:33 PM onwards.  Changes involved modifications to padding, font family, alignment, width, background color, box shadow, and margins, iteratively improving the visual presentation.  A key change at 7/9/2025, 6:43:27 PM introduced a full-screen gradient background and styled the container for a more visually appealing design. Another major update at 7/9/2025, 6:58:15 PM integrated error handling from `useCachedImage` to display error messages appropriately.  The input field was modified to convert the input to lowercase. The image height was also adjusted several times during development.


The most significant changes were the additions of error handling and performance logging in `useCachedImage.js` and the iterative styling improvements in `App.jsx`. The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement of both the functionality and the user interface.
