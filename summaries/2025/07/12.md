# Activity Summary for 7/12/2025

## 2:36:32 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Python script (`sifer_anomaly_detector.py`) for anomaly detection.  The script connects to a MySQL database, fetches behavioral and transactional data, calculates risk scores, and sends email alerts.

Significant changes over time include:

* **7/12/2025, 1:44:23 PM - 7/12/2025, 1:45:30 PM:**  Initial version of the script, showing complete functionality for anomaly detection based on behavioral and transactional data.  The script includes functions for database connection, data fetching, anomaly detection, risk score calculation, and email sending via the SendGrid API.  The code uses environment variables for database credentials and SendGrid API key.

* **7/12/2025, 1:50:11 PM - 7/12/2025, 1:51:18 PM:** No apparent changes in the code.


* **7/12/2025, 1:58:06 PM:**  Refactoring of the `.env` file loading process.  The script now verifies the existence of the `behavioral_events` and `sessions` tables before proceeding.  A `connect_timeout` parameter is added to the database connection.  Data fetching functions are updated to use pandas DataFrames for better data handling.


* **7/12/2025, 2:06:16 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:06:51 PM:** No apparent changes in the code.


* **7/12/2025, 2:11:22 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:12:30 PM:** Introduction of global variables `user_baselines_global` to store calculated baselines, improving efficiency. The `send_email` function is enhanced with a more robust check on the SendGrid API key length. An additional low threshold for the purchase amount is added to `ANOMALY_THRESHOLDS`.


* **7/12/2025, 2:14:11 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:17:11 PM:**  Further refinement to data fetching methods (`fetch_all_behavioral_data`), now returning empty DataFrames with correct columns if tables are missing.


* **7/12/2025, 2:21:02 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:23:46 PM:** The `send_email` function gains an `is_html` parameter to allow sending either plain text or HTML emails.


* **7/12/2025, 2:29:23 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:30:32 PM:** No apparent changes in the code.


* **7/12/2025, 2:33:40 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:36:00 PM:** Significant changes to the `.env` file path handling for better robustness. More detailed error messages are added for missing environment variables and API key issues.  The script now handles both `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` signals for graceful shutdown.  The `send_email` function is improved to check for valid SendGrid API key length (minimum 20 characters) and to handle various HTTP status codes from SendGrid, providing more specific error messages.  The calculation of the behavioral risk score is updated to separate scroll up and scroll down counts and adjust the corresponding risk score, making the risk assessment more granular. The transaction risk score calculation is refined to account for cases where the purchase amount is significantly lower than the average, suggesting potentially suspicious behavior.


The overall pattern shows a focus on improving error handling, robustness, and code clarity. The database interaction is improved, and anomaly detection logic becomes more sophisticated and precise, indicating an iterative process aimed at creating a production-ready anomaly detection system.


## 3:36:28 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two files: `sifer_api.py` and `Checkout.jsx`.  The `sifer_api.py` file, a Flask API endpoint, underwent two nearly identical revisions on July 12, 2025, at approximately 2:48 PM and 2:49 PM. These revisions appear to be minor formatting changes with no functional alterations. The API is designed to perform real-time risk checks using behavioral and transactional data.  It connects to a database to fetch user baselines and calculates an overall risk score based on input data.  If no baseline exists for a user, a default low-risk score is returned.

The `Checkout.jsx` file, a React component, experienced substantial changes throughout the afternoon of July 12, 2025.  Early revisions (around 2:51 PM, 2:58 PM, 2:59 PM, and 3:00 PM) removed code related to a previous S.I.F.E.R. data-sending mechanism and simplified the checkout process.  A later revision (around 3:02 PM) introduced a risk alert that displays after order placement, showing a message indicating the activation of the risk alert system, and prompting the user to check their email.  Further revisions (3:07 PM onwards) show a refactoring, changing how the anomaly detection is triggered, now using a dedicated `/api/start-anomaly-detector` endpoint rather than directly within the checkout process, to start the anomaly detector asynchronously after order placement.  The final versions of `Checkout.jsx` removed the direct integration with the S.I.F.E.R. system, relying instead on a background process to handle anomaly detection.

The `Cart.jsx` file also underwent significant changes, primarily between 3:17 PM and 3:34 PM. These modifications focused on improving the integration with the S.I.F.E.R. system (presumably for logging data) and handling the response appropriately.  Initially, the component interacted with a `trackerRef`, but later versions were updated to utilize a `TrackingContext` for managing the data submission. There was also a focus on user experience, including better toast messages and loading indicators.  The key change involved moving the S.I.F.E.R. data submission to a separate function and cleaning up the previous implementation for a smoother checkout flow and improved maintainability.  A "Risk Alert" toast is added to inform users to check their emails for security information after successful checkout, if authenticated.
