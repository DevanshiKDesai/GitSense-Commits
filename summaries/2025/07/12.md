# Activity Summary for 7/12/2025

## 2:36:32 PM
The log shows iterative development of a Python script (`sifer_anomaly_detector.py`) for anomaly detection.  The script connects to a MySQL database, fetches behavioral and transactional data, calculates risk scores, and sends email alerts.

Significant changes over time include:

* **7/12/2025, 1:44:23 PM - 7/12/2025, 1:45:30 PM:**  Initial version of the script, showing complete functionality for anomaly detection based on behavioral and transactional data.  The script includes functions for database connection, data fetching, anomaly detection, risk score calculation, and email sending via the SendGrid API.  The code uses environment variables for database credentials and SendGrid API key.

* **7/12/2025, 1:50:11 PM - 7/12/2025, 1:51:18 PM:** No apparent changes in the code.


* **7/12/2025, 1:58:06 PM:**  Refactoring of the `.env` file loading process.  The script now verifies the existence of the `behavioral_events` and `sessions` tables before proceeding.  A `connect_timeout` parameter is added to the database connection.  Data fetching functions are updated to use pandas DataFrames for better data handling.


* **7/12/2025, 2:06:16 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:06:51 PM:** No apparent changes in the code.


* **7/12/2025, 2:11:22 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:12:30 PM:** Introduction of global variables `user_baselines_global` to store calculated baselines, improving efficiency. The `send_email` function is enhanced with a more robust check on the SendGrid API key length. An additional low threshold for the purchase amount is added to `ANOMALY_THRESHOLDS`.


* **7/12/2025, 2:14:11 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:17:11 PM:**  Further refinement to data fetching methods (`fetch_all_behavioral_data`), now returning empty DataFrames with correct columns if tables are missing.


* **7/12/2025, 2:21:02 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:23:46 PM:** The `send_email` function gains an `is_html` parameter to allow sending either plain text or HTML emails.


* **7/12/2025, 2:29:23 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:30:32 PM:** No apparent changes in the code.


* **7/12/2025, 2:33:40 PM - 7/12/2025, 2:36:00 PM:** Significant changes to the `.env` file path handling for better robustness. More detailed error messages are added for missing environment variables and API key issues.  The script now handles both `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` signals for graceful shutdown.  The `send_email` function is improved to check for valid SendGrid API key length (minimum 20 characters) and to handle various HTTP status codes from SendGrid, providing more specific error messages.  The calculation of the behavioral risk score is updated to separate scroll up and scroll down counts and adjust the corresponding risk score, making the risk assessment more granular. The transaction risk score calculation is refined to account for cases where the purchase amount is significantly lower than the average, suggesting potentially suspicious behavior.


The overall pattern shows a focus on improving error handling, robustness, and code clarity. The database interaction is improved, and anomaly detection logic becomes more sophisticated and precise, indicating an iterative process aimed at creating a production-ready anomaly detection system.


## 3:36:28 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two files: `sifer_api.py` and `Checkout.jsx`.  The `sifer_api.py` file, a Flask API endpoint, underwent two nearly identical revisions on July 12, 2025, at approximately 2:48 PM and 2:49 PM. These revisions appear to be minor formatting changes with no functional alterations. The API is designed to perform real-time risk checks using behavioral and transactional data.  It connects to a database to fetch user baselines and calculates an overall risk score based on input data.  If no baseline exists for a user, a default low-risk score is returned.

The `Checkout.jsx` file, a React component, experienced substantial changes throughout the afternoon of July 12, 2025.  Early revisions (around 2:51 PM, 2:58 PM, 2:59 PM, and 3:00 PM) removed code related to a previous S.I.F.E.R. data-sending mechanism and simplified the checkout process.  A later revision (around 3:02 PM) introduced a risk alert that displays after order placement, showing a message indicating the activation of the risk alert system, and prompting the user to check their email.  Further revisions (3:07 PM onwards) show a refactoring, changing how the anomaly detection is triggered, now using a dedicated `/api/start-anomaly-detector` endpoint rather than directly within the checkout process, to start the anomaly detector asynchronously after order placement.  The final versions of `Checkout.jsx` removed the direct integration with the S.I.F.E.R. system, relying instead on a background process to handle anomaly detection.

The `Cart.jsx` file also underwent significant changes, primarily between 3:17 PM and 3:34 PM. These modifications focused on improving the integration with the S.I.F.E.R. system (presumably for logging data) and handling the response appropriately.  Initially, the component interacted with a `trackerRef`, but later versions were updated to utilize a `TrackingContext` for managing the data submission. There was also a focus on user experience, including better toast messages and loading indicators.  The key change involved moving the S.I.F.E.R. data submission to a separate function and cleaning up the previous implementation for a smoother checkout flow and improved maintainability.  A "Risk Alert" toast is added to inform users to check their emails for security information after successful checkout, if authenticated.


## 4:36:31 PM
The log shows iterative development of a React shopping cart application (`Cart.jsx`) integrated with a backend system ("S.I.F.E.R.") for anomaly detection and risk assessment.  The `Cart.jsx` component underwent significant changes related to integrating with the S.I.F.E.R. system, initially using a `TrackingContext` and later switching to a `TrackerRefContext` for accessing the system's `triggerSiferDataSubmission` function.  The initial integration involved a loading state (`isSubmittingSiferData`) and a readiness check (`isTrackingReady` or `isTrackerReady`).  Subsequent revisions simplified the process by removing unnecessary readiness checks, assuming `triggerSiferDataSubmission` handles them internally.  A final version removes the S.I.F.E.R. integration entirely from `Cart.jsx`, making the checkout process direct, only displaying a "Risk Alert" toast for authenticated users after navigation to the `/checkout` page.


The `Checkout.jsx` component was updated to remove the S.I.F.E.R. specific data sending logic.  Its function is now solely focused on handling the user's shipping and payment details and displaying an "Order Placed" toast.


The `AuthProvider.jsx` file remained largely unchanged, focusing on user authentication, cart management, and providing context for cart items and user status. It shows improved error handling and logging, specifically mentioning the storage and retrieval of user information (`auth_user_info`) and user IDs (`sifer_user_id`).


The backend (`main.py`) uses FastAPI and includes routers for users, sessions, behavior, and transactions, suggesting a well-structured API.


The `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` file is a Python script responsible for anomaly detection and risk assessment. It connects to a MySQL database (`sifer_db`), retrieves behavioral and transactional data, calculates risk scores based on predefined thresholds and mappings, and sends email alerts using the SendGrid API. The scriptâ€™s initial implementation of environment variable loading was improved for better error handling and more robust loading from a dedicated .env file first, falling back on system environment variables only if necessary.  The core logic of the risk assessment remained consistent throughout the revisions, but there were minor updates to the risk scoring calculations, particularly in `calculate_transaction_risk_score` where handling for unusually small purchases was added.  Database interaction logic within the script was also modified to use more robust methods, such as explicit error handling and better data integrity management in `fetch_all_behavioral_data`.


The `TrackingContext.jsx` file manages user activity tracking, collecting behavioral data (mouse clicks, keystrokes, scrolls, idle time) and integrating with the backend for session management (`createSession`). The changes highlight improvements in error handling, logging, and the dynamic update of the `userId` based on authentication status.


The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development on July 12th, 2025, between 3:36 PM and 4:32 PM, showcasing rapid iteration and refinement of the application's functionality.


## 5:36:23 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `sifer_anomaly_detector.py`, a Python script focused on anomaly detection and risk assessment.  The changes span from July 12th, 2025, 4:54 PM to 5:36 PM.

The initial versions (4:54 PM) establish the core functionality:  loading environment variables (including a SendGrid API key) from a `.env` file, handling Ctrl+C interrupts, sending emails via SendGrid, defining anomaly thresholds and risk level mappings, and implementing functions to calculate behavioral and transactional risk scores.  There's consistent effort towards robust error handling, particularly for API key issues and database connections.

Between 4:54 PM and 4:55 PM, the method of loading the `.env` file is adjusted, likely to improve path resolution regardless of the script's execution context.  Error messages related to the API key loading are also refined.  The SendGrid email function is updated to return a boolean indicating success or failure.

At 5:11 PM, the code is significantly extended to include a Flask application to receive behavioral data from a frontend.  This adds a data store, locking mechanism, API route for data input, and functions for retrieving recent frontend data.  The `fetch_all_behavioral_data` function is introduced, suggesting a shift towards combining frontend-provided and database-stored data for anomaly detection.  The anomaly detection logic (`detect_anomalies`) is added which checks for payment and behavioral anomalies based on established thresholds.

The subsequent changes primarily involve refining database interaction functions such as `fetch_combined_behavioral_data` and `fetch_new_behavioral_data`, showing a focus on integrating data from different sources effectively.  The final update at 5:36 PM adds the `random` module, likely for the implementation of OTP generation (One-Time Password) although this functionality isn't explicitly present in the provided code snippets.  There are no structural changes to the core anomaly detection or risk scoring logic during this final update.

The overall evolution demonstrates a progressive development process: starting with basic anomaly detection and email functionality, then adding Flask integration for real-time data ingestion, followed by refinement of database interactions and possible future integration of OTP generation.  A consistent pattern throughout the changes is the focus on detailed error handling and the use of helper functions to improve code clarity and maintainability.
