# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 12:00:50 AM
The log shows development of a backend for GeoDhrishti, an application processing geospatial data.  The primary changes revolve around a pipeline for calculating and exporting environmental indices (NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, NBR).

`run_pipeline.py` (7/16/2025, 11:19:49 PM and 11:20:09 PM): This file underwent minor revisions between the two timestamps. The core functionality remained unchanged:  It's a Flask API endpoint that receives user data (email, phone, threshold), processes geospatial data using functions from other modules (`calculate_indices`, `export_csv`, `export_geojson`, `export_shapefile`), and generates CSV, GeoJSON, and Shapefile outputs. A crucial addition between the two timestamps was the inclusion of the `send_alert` module, enabling email and SMS alerts if NDVI falls below a defined threshold.  The alerts leverage environment variables (for email and SMS credentials), which are not shown in the log.

`send_alert.py` (7/16/2025, 11:21:33 PM and 11:25:44 PM): This file contains functions for sending email and SMS alerts.  The primary change between the two timestamps was improved error handling and more informative print statements, which provide more details about the success or failure of sending emails and SMS messages. Also,  the `send_sms_alert` function's parameters were updated, changing the names of `sid` and `token` to `account_sid` and `auth_token`, respectively.

`run_all.py` (7/16/2025, 11:43:58 PM): This script defines a dictionary `inputs` specifying parameters for processing various indices ('NDVI', 'NDWI', 'NDBI', 'NBR') for different months ('june', 'july'). It orchestrates the calculation of these indices using `calculate_indices.run_index` and exports the results to CSV and GeoJSON using `export_csv.export_to_csv` and `export_geojson.export_to_geojson` functions.  This suggests a batch processing capability added later in the development process, separate from the real-time pipeline in `run_pipeline.py`.


The overall pattern shows a progression from a basic pipeline to one incorporating alerting mechanisms and batch processing capabilities. The use of a consistent file naming convention across the different export formats (CSV, GeoJSON, Shapefile) is evident. The time stamps demonstrate a short, focused development period on the 16th of July, 2025.
