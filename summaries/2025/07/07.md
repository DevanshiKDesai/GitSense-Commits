# Activity Summary for 7/7/2025

## 10:29:03 PM
The primary change on July 7, 2025, at 7:36:51 PM, involved updating `App.jsx` in a React application.  The code implements several interactive features:

* **Custom Cursor:** A dynamic cursor follows mouse movements, employing `useEffect` and `useState` hooks for state management and event listeners.

* **Typing Effect:**  The component displays a typing effect with four different messages (`typingTexts`), cycling through them with a delay.  `useCallback` is used for optimization and `setTimeout` manages the typing speed and deletion.  Clean up functions prevent memory leaks.

* **Magnetic Buttons:** Buttons in the navigation bar and hero section exhibit a "magnetic" effect, slightly moving towards the cursor within a certain radius. This effect is also implemented using `useEffect` for mouse event handling.

* **Scroll Animations:**  Sections on the page smoothly fade in and become highlighted in the navigation bar as the user scrolls.  This uses `setTimeout` for debouncing and manages element opacity and translation.

* **Smooth Scrolling:**  Navigation links provide smooth scrolling to different sections using `window.scrollTo`.

The code is structured using functional components, leveraging React hooks for state and side-effect management. It incorporates a responsive design with CSS classes and uses animations for visual appeal.  The application appears to be a marketing site for a satellite imagery-based environmental monitoring system, highlighting features like real-time alerts and change detection capabilities.  The navigation includes sections for Product, Features, Pricing, API, and Documentation.
