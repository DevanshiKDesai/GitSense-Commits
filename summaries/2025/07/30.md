# Activity Summary for 7/30/2025

## 12:21:56 AM
The `ndvi_summary_export.py` file underwent several revisions between July 29th and 30th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: calculating NDVI from satellite imagery ("BAND2", "BAND3", "BAND4"), applying cloud and no-data masks (cloud threshold at 700), and generating a combined CSV summarizing NDVI changes between two folders ("june25" and "june26").

The most significant changes occurred in the `run_index` and `process_all_ndvi` functions.  Initially (`7/29/2025, 11:28:08 PM`), `run_index` directly wrote the NDVI result to a GeoTIFF file.  Subsequent changes (`7/29/2025, 11:58:21 PM` onwards) modified `run_index` to return the NDVI array, its profile, and a reference raster path instead, eliminating the file writing step from this function. This change improved modularity.

The `process_all_ndvi` function was similarly altered.  Initially it took an output directory argument. This was later removed to solely return a list of tuples containing scene names, NDVI arrays, profile and reference paths.  This change streamlined the data handling and made it easier to process NDVI data from different folders.

The `export_combined_ndvi_csv` function remained largely unchanged, consistently appending to the "ndvi_summary.csv" file and performing coordinate transformations using `pyproj`.  A minor improvement involved using the reference raster path returned by `run_index` directly for georeferencing.

A final change, around `7/30/2025, 12:07:30 AM`, removed the `os.makedirs` call from the `run_index` function, suggesting the directory creation was handled elsewhere in the codebase or became unnecessary.  All other revisions were minor formatting adjustments or bug fixes.  The overall evolution of the code showcases a refactoring effort aimed at improving code structure and efficiency by separating data processing from file I/O operations.

The log shows changes made to two files.

**`useCachedImage.js` (7/30/2025, 4:48:42 PM):** This file contains a custom React hook, `useCachedImage`, designed to fetch and cache images.  The hook takes a `courseId` as input, checks local storage for a cached image associated with that course ID. If a valid cached image exists, it's used. Otherwise, it fetches the image from `https://picsum.photos/seed/{courseId}/300/200`, caches it with an expiry time of 50 minutes, and then displays it. Error handling is included for cases where the `courseId` is invalid.  The key features are local storage caching with expiry, error handling, and a clear structure using `useEffect` and `useState` hooks.

**`App.jsx` (7/30/2025, 5:13:12 PM, 5:13:17 PM, 5:13:57 PM):** This file, which renders a leaderboard, underwent multiple revisions within a short time frame. The code displays a leaderboard with search and sorting functionality. It uses React components (`RankCard`, `RankListItem`) to render the leaderboard data. The data is sourced from `leaderboardData.js`.  The main updates across the revisions were minor. The most significant change was a correction in line 64 in the last revision (7/30/2025, 5:13:57 PM) where a conditional operator was fixed within the JSX, changing `"hello"` to `:`.  The functionality remains consistent:  searching by participant name, sorting by score (ascending or descending), and displaying top 3 entries separately from the rest of the list.  The use of Tailwind CSS for styling is evident.  The multiple commits suggest iterative refinements to the UI or minor bug fixes rather than substantial functional changes.
