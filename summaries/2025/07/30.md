# Activity Summary for 7/30/2025

## 12:21:56 AM
The `ndvi_summary_export.py` file underwent several revisions between July 29th and 30th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: calculating NDVI from satellite imagery ("BAND2", "BAND3", "BAND4"), applying cloud and no-data masks (cloud threshold at 700), and generating a combined CSV summarizing NDVI changes between two folders ("june25" and "june26").

The most significant changes occurred in the `run_index` and `process_all_ndvi` functions.  Initially (`7/29/2025, 11:28:08 PM`), `run_index` directly wrote the NDVI result to a GeoTIFF file.  Subsequent changes (`7/29/2025, 11:58:21 PM` onwards) modified `run_index` to return the NDVI array, its profile, and a reference raster path instead, eliminating the file writing step from this function. This change improved modularity.

The `process_all_ndvi` function was similarly altered.  Initially it took an output directory argument. This was later removed to solely return a list of tuples containing scene names, NDVI arrays, profile and reference paths.  This change streamlined the data handling and made it easier to process NDVI data from different folders.

The `export_combined_ndvi_csv` function remained largely unchanged, consistently appending to the "ndvi_summary.csv" file and performing coordinate transformations using `pyproj`.  A minor improvement involved using the reference raster path returned by `run_index` directly for georeferencing.

A final change, around `7/30/2025, 12:07:30 AM`, removed the `os.makedirs` call from the `run_index` function, suggesting the directory creation was handled elsewhere in the codebase or became unnecessary.  All other revisions were minor formatting adjustments or bug fixes.  The overall evolution of the code showcases a refactoring effort aimed at improving code structure and efficiency by separating data processing from file I/O operations.
