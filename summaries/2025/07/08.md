# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 1:08:33 PM
The log shows the development of a React course card component using Tailwind CSS.

Initial commits (around 11:42 AM) set up the basic project structure: `App.jsx` renders a `CourseCard` with dummy data; `main.jsx` handles the React root rendering; and `index.css` sets up basic styling using Tailwind directives.

Around 12:59 PM,  `vite.config.js` was updated to include the `tailwindcss` plugin, and `index.css` was modified to use `@import "tailwindcss";` instead of individual `@tailwind` directives, simplifying the import process.  No functional changes are apparent in `vite.config.js` across its multiple updates.

The most significant changes occur between 1:04 PM and 1:05 PM, focusing on the `CourseCard.jsx` and `App.jsx` components.  `CourseCard.jsx` was significantly expanded to include:

*   More detailed course information (including `total_finished_questions` and `total_questions_in_course_tests`).
*   Progress bar visualization.
*   Conditional rendering based on user role ("learner," "admin," or "creator").
*   A hoverable dropdown menu (currently a placeholder).
*   "Verify" and "Reject" buttons for a "verify" type course.

`App.jsx` was updated to pass more comprehensive dummy course data to `CourseCard` including `total_finished_questions`, `total_questions_in_course_tests` and `publish_status`, and to provide placeholder functions for event handling.  A minor change  was also made to add explicit import statement for React in `App.jsx` at timestamp 1:04:48 PM.

In summary, the development process involved setting up a basic React project with Tailwind CSS, and then iteratively building out a more complex and feature-rich `CourseCard` component.  The updates are focused on improving the visual presentation and functionality of this component.
