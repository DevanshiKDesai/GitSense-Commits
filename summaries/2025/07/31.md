# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 4:32:13 PM
The log shows iterative development of two Python scripts: `match_scene_pairs.py` and `ndvi_summary_export.py`.  `match_scene_pairs.py` underwent several revisions focusing on data processing and visualization. Initially (7/31/2025, 2:20:16 PM and 2:21:37 PM), it read CSV files ("scene_coordinates_june25.csv", "scene_coordinates_june26.csv"), cleaned column names, created a "grid_key" for spatial matching, merged data based on this key, and saved matched scene pairs to "matched_scenes.csv".  A later revision (7/31/2025, 2:23:03 PM) added data visualization using `matplotlib`, creating a scatter plot of scene locations and saving it as "scene_coverage_map.png".

`ndvi_summary_export.py` evolved significantly.  The initial version (7/31/2025, 2:42:29 PM) calculated NDVI from BAND3 (red) and BAND4 (NIR) GeoTIFFs within each folder in specified input directories ("june25", "june26"), extracted scene center coordinates from "BAND_META.txt" files, and saved the results to individual CSV files ("ndvi_summary_june25.csv", "ndvi_summary_june26.csv"). Subsequent revisions (7/31/2025, 2:45:23 PM, 2:46:31 PM, and 2:51:26 PM) refined the NDVI calculation, error handling, and file processing logic.  These revisions improved robustness by handling missing files and introduced more detailed NDVI statistics (min, max, mean, std). The final version (7/31/2025, 2:51:26 PM) added more sophisticated handling of folder structures, checking for inner folders and accommodating variations in directory organization.  The output was consolidated to a single "output/ndvi_summary_individual.csv" file.  The consistent pattern across all `ndvi_summary_export.py` revisions is processing of "june25" and "june26" folders, indicating the processing of data from two different dates.
