# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 12:37:22 AM
The log shows a series of code changes across several files within a Python FastAPI backend and a React frontend application focused on user session and transaction tracking.

The `c:\Users\devan\Desktop\S.I.F.E.R\S.I.F.E.R\backend\app\routers\sessions.py` file underwent multiple revisions between 11:38 PM and 11:47 PM on June 30th, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor edits and likely focused on bug fixes and code cleanup, as the core functionality remains unchanged. The file defines API routes for creating, fetching (by user ID), and ending user sessions.  Error handling and database interactions (`SessionLocal`, `db.commit()`, `db.rollback()`) are consistently implemented across all routes.

On July 1st, 2025, changes occurred across multiple files reflecting a more substantial update:

* **`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\S.I.F.E.R\S.I.F.E.R\src\context\TrackingContext.jsx`**: This React component, modified around 12:00 AM, handles session tracking on the client-side. It creates a new session via a POST request to the backend, then tracks mouse clicks, keyboard presses, and idle time, sending a beacon signal on tab closure to update the session's `end_time` in the backend.  The user ID is retrieved from `localStorage`.

* **`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\S.I.F.E.R\S.I.F.E.R\backend\app\models.py`**:  The database models were updated several times between 12:08 AM and 12:36 AM. Key changes include the addition of a `session_id` column to the `Session` table (around 12:08 AM), changes to column names in the `TransactionProfile` table to follow a consistent naming convention (snake_case, around 12:24 AM), and the establishment of a many-to-many relationship between the `Session` and `TransactionProfile` models via the `transactions` relationship in the `Session` model (around 12:36 AM). These modifications suggest improved database schema design and data consistency.

* **`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\S.I.F.E.R\S.I.F.E.R\backend\app\base_schemas.py`**:  The Pydantic schemas were revised between 12:09 AM and 12:33 AM, primarily to update the schema for `TransactionProfile` to align with the database model changes (around 12:31 AM). The change from `orm_mode` to `from_attributes` in the config is a notable update reflecting changes in Pydantic's best practices.

* **`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\S.I.F.E.R\S.I.F.E.R\backend\app\routers\transaction.py`**:  This file, managing transaction-related API routes, experienced multiple revisions (between 12:10 AM and 12:32 AM), mainly adjusting function names and HTTP status codes to be more consistent and descriptive.  Importantly, the `TransactionProfile` model was renamed to `TransactionProfile` reflecting changes in the database model (around 12:13 AM).


* **`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\S.I.F.E.R\S.I.F.E.R\src\components\Allroutes.jsx`**: This file was updated at 12:14 AM, reflecting changes in routing for the React application.  No significant logic changes occurred.

* **`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\S.I.F.E.R\S.I.F.E.R\src\form\Login.jsx`**:  This React component (updated at 12:14 AM) handles user login. It now includes a function (`createSession`) which makes a POST request to the backend to create a session upon successful login, using the received user ID.


In summary, the initial changes on June 30th were minor adjustments to the session router, while the July 1st changes represent a coordinated effort to enhance the applicationâ€™s database schema, data consistency, API interactions, and frontend tracking capabilities. The improvements include better error handling, more consistent naming conventions, and updated Pydantic schemas.
