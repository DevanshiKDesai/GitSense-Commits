# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 3:54:24 PM
The codebase involves anomaly detection using user behavioral and transactional data from a MySQL database.  The `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` file, updated at 2:56:29 PM on August 27, 2025, focuses on fetching data from `behavioral_events` and `transaction_profiles` tables, calculating baselines for user behavior, and detecting anomalies based on pre-defined thresholds.  A key improvement is the corrected `behavioral_events` data fetching query, now correctly joining with the `sessions` table to get `user_id` and using `start_time` for timestamp ordering.

The `train_anomaly_model.py` file, updated at 2:56:41 PM on August 27, 2025, trains a neural network (autoencoder) model for anomaly detection. This script fetches data from the database, preprocesses it using `StandardScaler`, and trains an autoencoder model using the `MSELoss` criterion and Adam optimizer for 200 epochs. The trained model is saved as `anomaly_model.pth`. The training data is selected with a `WHERE` clause ensuring `average_purchase_value` is not NULL in the query which suggests that there might be missing or null values in the transactional data.  Both scripts utilize similar database connection configurations, relying on environment variables for database credentials.  The use of environment variables for database credentials is a best practice mentioned explicitly in `sifer_anomaly_detector.py`.
