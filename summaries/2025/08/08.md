# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 3:09:23 PM
The log shows several revisions to `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` and one revision to `TrackingContext.jsx`.

**`sifer_anomaly_detector.py` Changes:**

The Python script `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` underwent significant changes across multiple commits between 2:16 PM and 2:20 PM on August 8th, 2025.  The initial commit focused on fixing behavioral data joins within a MySQL database schema.  Subsequent commits added extensive functionality, including:

* **SendGrid Email Integration:**  The script was enhanced to send emails using the SendGrid API.  Error handling was implemented to manage API key issues and email sending failures. The SendGrid API key is loaded from a `.env` file, whose path is dynamically determined and error handled.

* **Real-time Anomaly Monitoring:**  A real-time monitoring loop was introduced, running at a configurable interval (`MONITORING_INTERVAL`).  The loop checks for new data within a specified time window (`REAL_TIME_WINDOW`).  A `signal_handler` function enables graceful shutdown using Ctrl+C.

* **Risk Scoring and Classification:**  The script now calculates risk scores (behavioral, transactional, pattern, and overall) based on anomaly detection and thresholds. These scores are mapped to risk levels (LOW, MODERATE, ELEVATED, HIGH, CRITICAL, etc.) using predefined mappings (`RISK_LEVELS`, `BEHAVIORAL_RISK_LEVELS`, `TRANSACTION_RISK_LEVELS`).  Safeguarding functions (`safe_float`, `safe_multiply`, `safe_compare`) were added to handle potential data type inconsistencies (e.g., Decimal vs. float).

* **Database Interaction Improvements:**  The database connection function (`get_db_connection`) was improved.  The data fetching functions (`fetch_all_behavioral_data`, `fetch_all_transaction_profiles`) now check for the existence of the necessary tables before attempting to query them.

* **Anomaly Detection Enhancements:**  The anomaly detection logic was expanded to include more detailed checks and improved handling of edge cases (e.g., zero average values).


**`TrackingContext.jsx` Changes:**

The React component `TrackingContext.jsx` was updated between 2:59 PM and 2:59 PM on August 8th, 2025. The key change involved integrating the `authenticatedUser` prop to dynamically determine the `userId` for tracking behavioral data.  The script now correctly waits for user authentication before creating a session, ensuring data is associated with a valid user ID. Event listeners are only added after the session has been created.  The `getBehavioralMetrics` function was added to return all the tracked data (mouse clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes, etc) in a format suitable for the back-end processing.


In summary, the `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` script evolved from a basic anomaly detection system to a more robust, real-time monitoring system with email alerts and risk scoring.  The `TrackingContext.jsx` component received an important update to improve its integration with user authentication.  Both components show evidence of well-considered design and error handling practices.


## 4:09:58 PM
The log shows development of a user management system.  The `models.py` file, updated twice within a minute (3:15 PM and 3:16 PM on August 8th, 2025), defines a SQLAlchemy database model with four tables: `users`, `sessions`, `behavioral_events`, and `transaction_profiles`. The second update to `models.py` adds a `user_id` foreign key to the `behavioral_events` table.  This suggests an improvement in data relationships, likely to better track user behavior within sessions.

At 3:29 PM, the `users.py` file (a FastAPI router) was modified to include a `/users/` endpoint for creating new users.  This endpoint performs email validation, checks for existing users, and includes robust error handling with logging using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.  The code handles HTTP exceptions and SQLAlchemy errors separately, logging them appropriately and returning informative HTTP error codes to the client.

Finally, at 3:30 PM, the `userApi.js` file (likely a frontend API client) was updated with functions (`createUser`, `getUser`, `getUserByEmail`) to interact with the `/users/` endpoint and handle potential errors during API calls.  The `createUser` function adds client-side input validation.  All functions include console logging for debugging purposes.  The overall pattern demonstrates a well-structured backend-frontend interaction, focusing on error handling and user experience.
