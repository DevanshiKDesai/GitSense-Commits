# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 3:09:23 PM
The log shows several revisions to `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` and one revision to `TrackingContext.jsx`.

**`sifer_anomaly_detector.py` Changes:**

The Python script `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` underwent significant changes across multiple commits between 2:16 PM and 2:20 PM on August 8th, 2025.  The initial commit focused on fixing behavioral data joins within a MySQL database schema.  Subsequent commits added extensive functionality, including:

* **SendGrid Email Integration:**  The script was enhanced to send emails using the SendGrid API.  Error handling was implemented to manage API key issues and email sending failures. The SendGrid API key is loaded from a `.env` file, whose path is dynamically determined and error handled.

* **Real-time Anomaly Monitoring:**  A real-time monitoring loop was introduced, running at a configurable interval (`MONITORING_INTERVAL`).  The loop checks for new data within a specified time window (`REAL_TIME_WINDOW`).  A `signal_handler` function enables graceful shutdown using Ctrl+C.

* **Risk Scoring and Classification:**  The script now calculates risk scores (behavioral, transactional, pattern, and overall) based on anomaly detection and thresholds. These scores are mapped to risk levels (LOW, MODERATE, ELEVATED, HIGH, CRITICAL, etc.) using predefined mappings (`RISK_LEVELS`, `BEHAVIORAL_RISK_LEVELS`, `TRANSACTION_RISK_LEVELS`).  Safeguarding functions (`safe_float`, `safe_multiply`, `safe_compare`) were added to handle potential data type inconsistencies (e.g., Decimal vs. float).

* **Database Interaction Improvements:**  The database connection function (`get_db_connection`) was improved.  The data fetching functions (`fetch_all_behavioral_data`, `fetch_all_transaction_profiles`) now check for the existence of the necessary tables before attempting to query them.

* **Anomaly Detection Enhancements:**  The anomaly detection logic was expanded to include more detailed checks and improved handling of edge cases (e.g., zero average values).


**`TrackingContext.jsx` Changes:**

The React component `TrackingContext.jsx` was updated between 2:59 PM and 2:59 PM on August 8th, 2025. The key change involved integrating the `authenticatedUser` prop to dynamically determine the `userId` for tracking behavioral data.  The script now correctly waits for user authentication before creating a session, ensuring data is associated with a valid user ID. Event listeners are only added after the session has been created.  The `getBehavioralMetrics` function was added to return all the tracked data (mouse clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes, etc) in a format suitable for the back-end processing.


In summary, the `sifer_anomaly_detector.py` script evolved from a basic anomaly detection system to a more robust, real-time monitoring system with email alerts and risk scoring.  The `TrackingContext.jsx` component received an important update to improve its integration with user authentication.  Both components show evidence of well-considered design and error handling practices.


## 4:09:58 PM
The log shows development of a user management system.  The `models.py` file, updated twice within a minute (3:15 PM and 3:16 PM on August 8th, 2025), defines a SQLAlchemy database model with four tables: `users`, `sessions`, `behavioral_events`, and `transaction_profiles`. The second update to `models.py` adds a `user_id` foreign key to the `behavioral_events` table.  This suggests an improvement in data relationships, likely to better track user behavior within sessions.

At 3:29 PM, the `users.py` file (a FastAPI router) was modified to include a `/users/` endpoint for creating new users.  This endpoint performs email validation, checks for existing users, and includes robust error handling with logging using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.  The code handles HTTP exceptions and SQLAlchemy errors separately, logging them appropriately and returning informative HTTP error codes to the client.

Finally, at 3:30 PM, the `userApi.js` file (likely a frontend API client) was updated with functions (`createUser`, `getUser`, `getUserByEmail`) to interact with the `/users/` endpoint and handle potential errors during API calls.  The `createUser` function adds client-side input validation.  All functions include console logging for debugging purposes.  The overall pattern demonstrates a well-structured backend-frontend interaction, focusing on error handling and user experience.


## 6:10:03 PM
The log shows development on a FastAPI backend and a SendGrid email sending module.  The main focus is on the `/users/` endpoint for user creation and a new endpoint `/users/{user_id}/send-report` to send anomaly reports via email.

**`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\3rd Year Assignments\Walmart Hackathon\S.I.F.E.R new\S.I.F.E.R\sifer_ai\send_email.py`**: This file contains the SendGrid email sending logic.  It remained largely unchanged throughout the log except for a crucial correction around 5:56 PM where  `to_emails=user_email` was changed to `to_emails=to_email` fixing a bug where email was not sent correctly. The file uses environment variables to store the SendGrid API key.

**`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\3rd Year Assignments\Walmart Hackathon\S.I.F.E.R new\S.I.F.E.R\backend\app\routers\users.py`**: This file contains the FastAPI route definitions. Significant changes occurred between 5:28 PM and 5:38 PM. Initially, a user creation endpoint was implemented. Later, a new endpoint (`/users/{user_id}/send-report`) was added to asynchronously send anomaly reports to users.  Several revisions focused on correctly importing the `send_anomaly_report_email` function from the `sifer_ai` module.  The import path was corrected multiple times, ultimately settling on  `from app.sifer_ai.send_email import send_anomaly_report_email` at 5:38 PM and then again at 6:05 PM to fix import issues caused by the project structure.  The addition of `sys.path.append()` at 6:02 PM was added to correct import path issues related to the project's file structure.

**`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\3rd Year Assignments\Walmart Hackathon\S.I.F.E.R new\S.I.F.E.R\backend\app\schemas\user.py`**: This file defines Pydantic models (`UserCreate`, `UserResponse`) for user data, with the notable addition of `from_attributes = True` in the `Config` class (5:39 PM), essential for proper SQLAlchemy ORM integration.

**`c:\Users\devan\Desktop\3rd Year Assignments\Walmart Hackathon\S.I.F.E.R new\S.I.F.E.R\backend\app\main.py`**: This file is the main FastAPI application entry point. A simple addition to ensure the `backend` folder is added to the system's python path to correct the import problems.  This was added at 6:02 PM.


In summary, the log demonstrates the iterative development of a user management system with email notification functionality.  The majority of the changes revolve around correctly managing the import path for the email sending module, and implementing the new endpoint to send emails asynchronously after creating new users.  A bug fix in the email sending module was also implemented, and the use of Pydantic models was seen in defining the structure of the user data.


## 8:17:17 PM
The log shows development across frontend and backend components of a Walmart-like e-commerce application called S.I.F.E.R.  Significant changes occurred between 7:20 PM and 8:16 PM on August 8, 2025.

**Backend Changes:**

* **`app/schemas/user.py` (7:20 PM, 8:12 PM):** This file defines Pydantic schemas for user data.  Initially, it included `UserCreate` and `UserResponse` models for user creation and retrieval. A crucial `Config` section was added for SQLAlchemy ORM compatibility.  Later, a `password` field was added to `UserCreate` to handle password storage (although a placeholder hashing function is used in the backend).  The `password` field is excluded from the `UserResponse` for security reasons.

* **`app/routers/users.py` (7:23 PM, 7:34 PM, 7:59 PM, 8:05 PM, 8:13 PM):**  This file contains FastAPI routes for user management.  Initially, there were routes for user creation (`/users/`) and retrieval by email (`/users/by-email/{email}`). Error handling was improved over time, including adding more specific HTTP status codes and detailed error messages.  A `/send-report` endpoint was added to send asynchronous email reports to users.   The initial version had path manipulation to manually add the backend folder to the Python path.  This was removed in later revisions. The `send_anomaly_report_email` function call (for sending reports) is commented out in a later version due to circular dependency issues.  Finally, the code includes a placeholder password hashing function (`hash_password`), highlighting the need for a robust password hashing library in a production environment. The endpoint now correctly hashes the password before saving it.  Error handling was further improved by catching `IntegrityError` for database validation issues and providing more specific error messages.


**Frontend Changes:**

* **`src/api/userApi.js` (7:59 PM):** This file contains Axios functions for interacting with the backend user API endpoints.  It includes functions for `createUser` and `getUserByEmail`, with comprehensive error handling and logging.

* **`src/AuthContext/AuthProvider.jsx` (7:59 PM, 8:03 PM, 8:13 PM):** This component manages authentication state.  It uses the `userApi` functions to handle user login and registration. It also includes dummy product data (unchanged throughout the log), cart management, and UI-related state management.   There is significant logging throughout, useful for debugging. The login logic now correctly updates `sifer_user_id` in localStorage.

* **`src/context/TrackingContext.jsx` (7:59 PM):** This component tracks user activity (mouse clicks, keystrokes, scrolling, etc.) and sends data to the backend.  It uses a unique user ID (`sifer_user_id`) from local storage. The important addition is the ability to pass `authenticatedUser` which dynamically sets userId when it's available.  The session creation now depends correctly on the `userId` state.

* **`src/form/Login.jsx` (7:59 PM):** This component provides a login form. It redirects to account creation if the user doesn't exist and handles various login scenarios through toast messages.

* **`src/App.jsx` (8:00 PM):**  This is the main application component. It handles the initial setup of S.I.F.E.R. tracking user creation, utilizing `localStorage` for persisting the `sifer_user_id`.  If `sifer_user_id` does not exist it creates a new user in the backend for tracking purposes, ensuring a unique user ID for tracking.  Error handling is implemented to manage failed backend communications.  The App component now waits until the `appUserId` is fetched before rendering the main app content.

* **`src/form/AccountCreateForm.jsx` (8:14 PM, 8:16 PM):** This component handles account creation.   A bug fix removes an useEffect hook that interfered with redirection.  A significant update adds password and confirm password fields with validation.


**Overall Pattern:**

The changes reflect an iterative development process, with continuous improvement of error handling, logging, and security measures.  There's a clear focus on integrating frontend and backend components, handling authentication, and implementing user activity tracking for S.I.F.E.R. security. The later changes show a strong focus on user experience improvements and comprehensive validation of the user inputs.


## 11:05:17 PM
The log shows development across frontend and backend components of a web application, likely an e-commerce platform, focusing on user account creation and authentication.

**`AccountCreateForm.jsx` (Frontend):**  This file underwent several revisions between 10:06 PM and 10:57 PM.  Initial versions included password and confirm password fields, with client-side validation for password length and matching.  Subsequent commits removed these fields, shifting password handling entirely to the backend.  A significant bug fix removed a `useEffect` hook that caused premature redirection of authenticated users.  The final version simplifies the form, relying on backend validation and improved error handling through toasts.


**`base_schemas.py` (Backend):** This file, updated at 10:13 PM, defines Pydantic schemas for user creation (`UserCreate`), user response (`UserResponse`), sessions, behavioral events, and transaction profiles.  The schemas specify data types and structure for database interactions.


**`user.py` (Backend):**  Modified at 10:15 PM, this file contains Pydantic schemas for user creation and response. Notably, the `password` field was removed from the `UserCreate` schema, reflecting the backend's responsibility for password management.


**`users.py` (Backend):** Updated at 11:02 PM, this FastAPI router handles user creation.  A crucial change replaces a placeholder password hashing function with `passlib.context.CryptContext` to securely hash passwords using bcrypt.  The `create_user` function now generates, hashes, and stores passwords securely, responding with only the necessary user details. The improved error handling provides more descriptive error messages.


**`userApi.js` (Frontend):**  This API file, updated several times between 10:21 PM and 10:55 PM, defines functions for interacting with the backend user API.  Changes focused on improving error handling, especially 422 validation errors, providing more informative error messages to the user. The final version corrects the keys sent to the backend to match the server-side API's expected input.


**`AuthProvider.jsx` (Frontend):** This file, updated multiple times from 10:30 PM to 10:57 PM, manages authentication state.  The `register` function was significantly improved to handle the updated backend API. The `login` and `register` functions now use `try...catch` blocks for better error handling, and the `register` function now correctly sends the form data to the backend. The `login` and `register` functions now use `useCallback` for improved performance.  The final version includes a `signOut` function to handle user logout.


**`Signin.jsx` (Frontend):**  This Signin component was modified at 10:47 PM and 10:58 PM.  The initial changes improved error handling. The final version removes unnecessary toasts, relying on the AuthProvider for status messaging, making the component simpler and more efficient.


Throughout the log, there's a consistent pattern of improving error handling and refining the interaction between the frontend and backend. The backend was updated to handle password security effectively, and the frontend was updated to work with the improved API and handle errors more gracefully.  The use of `useCallback` in `AuthProvider.jsx` demonstrates a focus on performance optimization.
