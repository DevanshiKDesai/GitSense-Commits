# Activity Summary for 8/22/2025

## 10:31:50 PM
The log shows code changes primarily focused on building and improving an anomaly detection system.  The most significant changes occurred on August 22nd, 2025, between 9:54 PM and 9:55 PM.

`train_anomaly_model.py` was updated at 9:54:08 PM. This file contains a Python script that trains a behavior autoencoder model using data fetched from a MySQL database. The model uses keystroke count, mouse clicks, and other behavioral metrics along with purchase amounts to identify anomalies. The script connects to the database using environment variables for credentials, processes data using pandas and scikit-learn, and trains a PyTorch neural network.  The trained model is then saved.

`sifer_anomaly_detector.py` was updated at 9:54:39 PM. This file seems to be designed for anomaly detection, using thresholds to compare recent user activity against calculated baselines.  The code fetches behavioral and transaction data from a MySQL database, calculates baselines for each user (requiring a minimum number of data points), and then compares current activity against these baselines to detect anomalies.  The commented-out nature of much of the code suggests it's either under development or has undergone significant refactoring.  The comments highlight updates to the data fetching query to correctly join data from behavioral and session tables, a fix for a column name, and also contains  anomaly thresholds for various behavioral metrics and purchase amounts.
