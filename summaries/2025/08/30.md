# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 3:57:09 PM
The codebase underwent several updates on August 30, 2025, primarily focusing on user API endpoints and authentication.

**`userApi.js` (multiple timestamps):** This file saw iterative changes throughout the afternoon.  Initially, it contained functions for creating users (`createUser`), getting users by ID (`getUser`), and by email (`getUserByEmail`), along with a combined `getOrCreateUserByEmail` function. A new function, `updateUserLocation`, was added to update user location data.  Later, a `loginUser` function was added, replacing the previous login functionality and handling location updates during login.  The most significant change was the addition of the `loginUser` function and the related API route changes in the backend.  The timestamps for the changes in this file are 3:02:47 PM, 3:03:40 PM, 3:14:59 PM, and 3:17:22 PM.  There's a clear pattern of adding error handling (`try...catch` blocks) and logging statements (`console.log`, `console.error`) for all API calls.  The `getUserByEmail` function had a comment indicating a fix related to query parameters.

**`Login.jsx` (multiple timestamps):**  This React component handles user login.  The most notable changes relate to incorporating geolocation data into the login process. The component now retrieves the user's location using `navigator.geolocation` and passes it to the `login` function.  This component also includes error handling and loading state management. The relevant timestamps are 3:05:51 PM, 3:18:06 PM, and 3:18:15 PM. The UI remains largely unchanged, focusing on visual feedback during login.

**`base_schemas.py` (two timestamps):** This Python file defines Pydantic schemas for various data models.  Initially, the `UserCreate` schema lacked latitude and longitude fields.  These fields were added later to accommodate location data during user creation and login. The timestamps are 3:07:12 PM and 3:48:02 PM. This reflects the backend adaptation to store user location information.

**`routers\users.py` (two timestamps):** This FastAPI router defines the backend API endpoints for user management.  The routes for creating users (`/users/`), retrieving users by email (`/users/by-email/{email}`), and by ID (`/users/{user_id}`) were corrected to match the expected paths.  A new `/users/login` endpoint was also added to handle user login and location update.  The timestamps are 3:30:50 PM and 3:33:13 PM. The changes demonstrate a consistent effort to align the backend API routes with the frontend API calls.

**`AuthProvider.jsx` (one timestamp):** This React component provides authentication context. It shows the addition of geolocation state (`latitude`, `longitude`), and the use of these values in both `login` and `register` functions for sending location information to the server.  The `login` function now includes the location coordinates in the request. This component was updated at 3:35:26 PM to reflect the backend changes.  The cart and product data remain untouched.  The `login` and `register` functions are updated to incorporate the geolocation data when available.
