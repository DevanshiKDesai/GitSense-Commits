# Activity Summary for 8/9/2025

## 12:05:11 AM
The log shows development across several files related to a backend and frontend for an application called S.I.F.E.R., likely a security or fraud detection system.  The activity spans August 8th and 9th, 2025.

**`base_schemas.py` (8/8/2025, 11:05:54 PM & 8/9/2025, 12:02:38 AM):** This file defines Pydantic schemas for user accounts, sessions, behavioral events, and transaction profiles.  The changes between the timestamps are minimal, suggesting no functional changes to the schema definitions themselves.

**`routers/users.py` (8/8/2025, 11:20:29 PM, 11:23:16 PM, 11:25:25 PM & 8/8/2025, 11:32:57 PM):** This file contains FastAPI routers for user management.  Multiple edits suggest iterative development of the `/users/` endpoint.  The main change involves adding secure password hashing (bcrypt) and random password generation upon user creation.  A minor edit corrected a route path from `/users/by-email/{email}` to `/by-email/{email}`. The later changes are mostly cosmetic.

**`models.py` (8/8/2025, 11:32:30 PM):** This file defines SQLAlchemy models for the database, mirroring the schemas. A `password` column was added to the `User` model to store hashed passwords.  The file also includes a line to create all database tables (`Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`), ensuring the database structure is set up.

**`send_email.py` (8/8/2025, 11:54:11 PM):** This module handles sending anomaly reports via SendGrid. It retrieves the SendGrid API key from environment variables.  Includes error handling and a test section.

**`sifer_anomaly_detector.py` (8/8/2025, 11:55:58 PM & 8/8/2025, 11:56:51 PM):** This is the core anomaly detection module. It connects to a MySQL database, fetches data, calculates risk scores (behavioral, transactional, pattern, and overall), and sends email alerts based on pre-defined thresholds. The small changes between the two timestamps are likely minor fixes or adjustments rather than significant functional changes.  The module uses environment variables for database credentials and the SendGrid API key, employing `load_dotenv` for configuration. It also implements a signal handler for graceful shutdown.

**`UserActivityTracker.jsx` (8/9/2025, 12:02:47 AM):** This React component tracks user activity (keystrokes, mouse clicks, scrolls, idle time), and sends this data to the backend.  A key update adds the `session_id` to transaction profile data sent to the backend.

**`schemas/behavior.py` (8/9/2025, 12:02:56 AM):** This file defines Pydantic schemas for behavioral events, replacing `orm_mode` with `from_attributes` (Pydantic v2 compatibility).

**`userApi.js` (8/9/2025, 12:03:26 AM):** This frontend API module handles communication with the backend's user-related endpoints, including detailed error handling.

**`App.jsx` (8/9/2025, 12:03:32 AM):** This React component handles the main application logic.  On initial load, it checks for a S.I.F.E.R user ID in local storage; if not found, it creates a new user in the backend for tracking purposes only, storing the ID in local storage.  It then renders the main application, passing relevant data to child components.  The application utilizes several context providers (`AuthContext`, `CartProvider`, `TrackingContextProvider`) for state management.


In summary, the codebase implements a system for user activity tracking and anomaly detection, including user registration, session management, data collection (frontend), data processing and anomaly detection (backend), and alert notifications (email).  The development process involved iterative refinement of backend routes, robust error handling, and integrating a frontend component for real-time data collection.


## 1:05:13 AM
The log shows multiple code changes across backend (Python) and frontend (JavaScript) components of a system, likely an e-commerce platform with a fraud detection system called S.I.F.E.R.  The changes span from August 9th, 2025, between 12:11 AM and 1:02 AM.

**`sifer_anomaly_detector.py` (Backend):** This file, which is the core of the S.I.F.E.R. anomaly detection system, remained largely unchanged across multiple commits.  It defines functions for:

* **Email Sending:** Uses the SendGrid API to send anomaly reports. The API key is loaded from environment variables. Error handling is included.
* **Database Connection:** Connects to a MySQL database (credentials from environment variables).
* **Data Fetching:** Fetches behavioral and transactional data from the database using Pandas.  The code indicates the existence of `behavioral_events` and `sessions` tables.
* **Risk Score Calculation:** Calculates behavioral, transactional, and overall risk scores based on various metrics and thresholds.  These scores are mapped to risk levels (LOW, MODERATE, etc.).
* **Signal Handling:**  Implements graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C.


**`userApi.js`, `transactionApi.js`, `behaviorApi.js` (Frontend):** These files define API interaction functions for creating users, sessions, and handling behavioral and transactional data.  They use axios to make requests to the backend (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`).  They include robust error handling, logging success and failure details.  There was a minor change in `transactionApi.js` related to a correction in the POST endpoint from `/transactions/` to `/transactions/profile`.


**`Cart.jsx` (Frontend):**  This component handles the shopping cart functionality.  Significant changes were made to integrate with S.I.F.E.R.:

* **S.I.F.E.R. Data Submission:** The `handleContinueToCheckout` function now waits for session initialization before submitting purchase data (`average_purchase_value`, `purchase_frequency`, `last_purchase_amount`) to the S.I.F.E.R. system via a reference to `UserActivityTracker`. It also shows toasts indicating data submission status and risk alerts.
* **Dynamic Recommendations:** Uses `useEffect` to dynamically generate product recommendations based on cart items.
* **Estimated Delivery Date:** Calculates an estimated delivery date.

**`UserActivityTracker.jsx` (Frontend):** This component tracks user activity and submits it to the backend. Key changes include:

* **Data Payload Refinement:** The structure of the behavioral and transaction data payloads sent to the backend was carefully crafted to match the Pydantic schemas (`BehavioralEventCreate` and `TransactionProfileCreate`).  Null/undefined values are handled with default values (0).
* **Combined Data Submission:**  It now sends both behavioral and transactional data in a single request to `/transactions/profile`, ensuring consistency.


**`send_email.py` (Backend):** This small module provides a function to send anomaly detection reports via SendGrid.  It handles API key retrieval and error scenarios.  Includes instructions for setting the environment variable `SENDGRID_API_KEY`.

**`database.py` (Backend):** This file manages the SQLAlchemy database connection. It reads database credentials securely from environment variables and raises a `ValueError` if any are missing. No code changes were made across multiple commits.

**`schemas/transaction.py` (Backend):** Defines Pydantic models (`TransactionProfileCreate` and `TransactionProfileResponse`) for validating transaction data. The `TransactionProfileCreate` model was updated to include a `total_spent` field instead of just `last_purchase_amount`.

**`models.py` (Backend):**  The database models are defined here using SQLAlchemy.  Significant changes were made to the `TransactionProfile` model. The `last_purchase_time` column was renamed to `last_purchase_date`, and several new columns (`session_id`, `total_spent`, `purchase_count`) were added to better track transactional activity.  The `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line ensures tables are created if they do not exist.

**`routers/users.py` (Backend):** This file defines FastAPI routes for user management. It includes a function to generate and hash passwords securely using bcrypt, providing increased security in creating new users.  A route to retrieve a user by email is also defined.


In summary, the code changes primarily focus on improving the integration between the frontend and backend, enhancing security by using bcrypt for password hashing and adding error handling across functions, and refining the data model to more accurately track user activity and transaction data for the S.I.F.E.R. fraud detection system.  The changes demonstrate a shift towards better data handling and security practices.
