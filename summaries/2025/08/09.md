# Activity Summary for 8/9/2025

## 12:05:11 AM
The log shows development across several files related to a backend and frontend for an application called S.I.F.E.R., likely a security or fraud detection system.  The activity spans August 8th and 9th, 2025.

**`base_schemas.py` (8/8/2025, 11:05:54 PM & 8/9/2025, 12:02:38 AM):** This file defines Pydantic schemas for user accounts, sessions, behavioral events, and transaction profiles.  The changes between the timestamps are minimal, suggesting no functional changes to the schema definitions themselves.

**`routers/users.py` (8/8/2025, 11:20:29 PM, 11:23:16 PM, 11:25:25 PM & 8/8/2025, 11:32:57 PM):** This file contains FastAPI routers for user management.  Multiple edits suggest iterative development of the `/users/` endpoint.  The main change involves adding secure password hashing (bcrypt) and random password generation upon user creation.  A minor edit corrected a route path from `/users/by-email/{email}` to `/by-email/{email}`. The later changes are mostly cosmetic.

**`models.py` (8/8/2025, 11:32:30 PM):** This file defines SQLAlchemy models for the database, mirroring the schemas. A `password` column was added to the `User` model to store hashed passwords.  The file also includes a line to create all database tables (`Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`), ensuring the database structure is set up.

**`send_email.py` (8/8/2025, 11:54:11 PM):** This module handles sending anomaly reports via SendGrid. It retrieves the SendGrid API key from environment variables.  Includes error handling and a test section.

**`sifer_anomaly_detector.py` (8/8/2025, 11:55:58 PM & 8/8/2025, 11:56:51 PM):** This is the core anomaly detection module. It connects to a MySQL database, fetches data, calculates risk scores (behavioral, transactional, pattern, and overall), and sends email alerts based on pre-defined thresholds. The small changes between the two timestamps are likely minor fixes or adjustments rather than significant functional changes.  The module uses environment variables for database credentials and the SendGrid API key, employing `load_dotenv` for configuration. It also implements a signal handler for graceful shutdown.

**`UserActivityTracker.jsx` (8/9/2025, 12:02:47 AM):** This React component tracks user activity (keystrokes, mouse clicks, scrolls, idle time), and sends this data to the backend.  A key update adds the `session_id` to transaction profile data sent to the backend.

**`schemas/behavior.py` (8/9/2025, 12:02:56 AM):** This file defines Pydantic schemas for behavioral events, replacing `orm_mode` with `from_attributes` (Pydantic v2 compatibility).

**`userApi.js` (8/9/2025, 12:03:26 AM):** This frontend API module handles communication with the backend's user-related endpoints, including detailed error handling.

**`App.jsx` (8/9/2025, 12:03:32 AM):** This React component handles the main application logic.  On initial load, it checks for a S.I.F.E.R user ID in local storage; if not found, it creates a new user in the backend for tracking purposes only, storing the ID in local storage.  It then renders the main application, passing relevant data to child components.  The application utilizes several context providers (`AuthContext`, `CartProvider`, `TrackingContextProvider`) for state management.


In summary, the codebase implements a system for user activity tracking and anomaly detection, including user registration, session management, data collection (frontend), data processing and anomaly detection (backend), and alert notifications (email).  The development process involved iterative refinement of backend routes, robust error handling, and integrating a frontend component for real-time data collection.
