# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 8:04:07 PM
The codebase underwent several revisions on August 29, 2025, primarily focusing on the `models.py` and `schemas.py` files.  The most significant changes involved adding geolocation data (latitude and longitude) to the `User` model and a `payment_method` field to the `TransactionProfile` model.  These additions were reflected in both the database models (`models.py`) and the corresponding Pydantic schemas (`schemas.py`).  Multiple updates to `models.py` between 7:36 PM and 8:03 PM suggest iterative refinements or corrections to the database schema.

The `crud.py` file remained relatively static, with only a minor redundant commit at 7:22 PM.  This file contains functions for user creation, retrieval, and location update, all consistently utilizing the `models.User` object. The `user.py` schema file was updated at 7:57 PM to include `transaction_score` and `behavior_score` fields in the `UserResponse` model, indicating a potential addition of scoring or ranking functionality.  The overall pattern shows a development process focused on enhancing the user model with additional information, including location and transaction details.
