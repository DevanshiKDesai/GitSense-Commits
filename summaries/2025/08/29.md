# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 8:04:07 PM
The codebase underwent several revisions on August 29, 2025, primarily focusing on the `models.py` and `schemas.py` files.  The most significant changes involved adding geolocation data (latitude and longitude) to the `User` model and a `payment_method` field to the `TransactionProfile` model.  These additions were reflected in both the database models (`models.py`) and the corresponding Pydantic schemas (`schemas.py`).  Multiple updates to `models.py` between 7:36 PM and 8:03 PM suggest iterative refinements or corrections to the database schema.

The `crud.py` file remained relatively static, with only a minor redundant commit at 7:22 PM.  This file contains functions for user creation, retrieval, and location update, all consistently utilizing the `models.User` object. The `user.py` schema file was updated at 7:57 PM to include `transaction_score` and `behavior_score` fields in the `UserResponse` model, indicating a potential addition of scoring or ranking functionality.  The overall pattern shows a development process focused on enhancing the user model with additional information, including location and transaction details.


## 9:04:12 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `models.py` file, focusing on database schema changes, and related changes in React components (`Checkout.jsx`, `AccountCreateForm.jsx`, `Login.jsx`) and backend routing (`sessions.py`).  The `crud.py` file shows database operations.


**`app\models.py` (Multiple Timestamps):** This file underwent several revisions.  Initial changes (around 8:05 PM) added `latitude` and `longitude` columns to the `User` table and a `payment_method` column to the `TransactionProfile` table.  Later (around 8:17 PM), `transaction_score` and `behavior_score` columns were added to the `User` table. A subsequent update at 8:22 PM corrected a minor issue, ensuring that the `transaction_score` and `behavior_score` columns in the `User` model had `default=0.0`, instead of being nullable.


**`app\crud.py` (8/29/2025, 8:19:20 PM):** This file contains CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `User` model.  The functions `create_user` and `update_user_location` reflect the addition of latitude and longitude in the `models.py` file.


**`src\components\Checkout.jsx` (8/29/2025, 8:19:13 PM):**  This component was updated to send the selected `paymentMethod` to the backend during order placement. The backend endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/transactions/`. This reflects the addition of the `payment_method` column in the `TransactionProfile` model.


**`src\form\AccountCreateForm.jsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component saw significant changes. Initially (around 8:22 PM), it was a basic account creation form. A crucial update at 8:28 PM added geolocation functionality.  The component now uses `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` to obtain the user's latitude and longitude, and it sends this information to the backend along with user registration data.


**`src\form\Login.jsx` (8/29/2025, 8:56:00 PM):** Similar to `AccountCreateForm.jsx`, this component was updated to incorporate geolocation data. It retrieves the user's location and includes it in the login request sent to the backend.


**`backend\app\routers\sessions.py` (8/29/2025, 8:35:28 PM):** This file defines API routes for session management. It shows standard RESTful endpoints for creating, ending and retrieving sessions using UUIDs for unique session identifiers.  Error handling is included to manage HTTP exceptions.


**Recurring Elements:**  A common theme across the code changes is the consistent addition of geolocation data (latitude and longitude) to the user model and its usage in both frontend and backend processes.  The use of `useCallback` and `useEffect` hooks in the React components and error handling in both the frontend and backend code are also noteworthy. The use of Chakra UI for components is consistent throughout the frontend code.
