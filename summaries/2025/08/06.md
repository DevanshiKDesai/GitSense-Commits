# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 11:48:31 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `AuthProvider.jsx` and one update to `Cart.jsx` between 8/6/2025, 10:59:39 PM and 11:40:10 PM.

`AuthProvider.jsx`:  The file underwent several revisions focused primarily on cart management and authentication.  The initial version contained dummy product data and basic authentication and cart functionality.  Subsequent changes improved cart handling, particularly regarding persistence in local storage.  The key improvement was switching from a single `walmart_clone_cart` key to a user-specific key (`cart_${authState.user.email}`) for persistent cart data, ensuring that each user's cart is preserved separately.  Error handling around local storage operations was also enhanced.  No significant changes were made to the dummy product data itself.


`Cart.jsx`: This component was updated to integrate with a `UserActivityTracker`.  A crucial addition is the conditional navigation to either the checkout page ("/product/checkout") for logged-in users or the login page ("/account/login") for unauthenticated users after a successful S.I.F.E.R. data submission.  The component now dynamically generates recommended products based on the user's cart items.  Error handling and loading states (using `useToast` and `Spinner`) were added for a better user experience. The update also includes improved handling of empty carts and a robust error-handling mechanism when submitting S.I.F.E.R data.  The `estimatedDeliveryDate` is calculated dynamically, adding three days to the current date.
